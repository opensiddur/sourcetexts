PUBLISHERS’ FOREWORD.

<The Standard Prayer Book> is an American reprint of The Authorized Daily Prayer Book, which is in general use today throughout the British Empire. It was originally published under the authorization of the late Chief Rabbi, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler. The English translation, by the Rev. Simeon Singer, is universally acknowledged to be the best ever published. This American edition is set from new and larger type and is characterized by the continuity of the text, which has necessitated the addition of nearly 300 pages, making it the most complete daily prayer-book ever published.

MORNING PRAYER FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who removest sleep from mine eyes, and slumber from mine eyelids.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast given us the Law of truth, and hast planted everlasting life in our midst.

Moses commanded us the Law as an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.

Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One, Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever.

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

And these words which I command thee this day shall be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates.

O my God, guard my tongue from evil, and my lips from speaking guile.

Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments.

Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

PRAYER ON ENTERING THE SYNAGOGUE.

On entering the Synagogue say the following:—

As for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: I will worship toward thy holy temple in the fear of thee.

$Into the house of God we will walk with the throng.

How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, thy dwelling places, O Israel! As for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: I will worship toward thy holy temple in the fear of thee. Lord, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth. As for me, I will worship and bow down: I will bend the knee before the Lord, my Maker. And as for me, may my prayer unto thee, O Lord, be in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, answer me in the truth of thy salvation./$

MORNING SERVICE.

1. Magnified and praised be the living God: he is, and there is no limit in time unto his being.

2. He is One, and there is no unity like unto his unity; inconceivable is he, and unending is his unity.

3. He hath neither bodily form nor substance: we can compare nought unto him in his holiness.

4. He was before anything that hath been created—even the first: but his existence had no beginning.

5. Behold he is the Lord of the universe: to every creature he teacheth his greatness and his sovereignty.

6. The rich gift of his prophecy he gave unto the men of his choice, in whom he gloried.

{p. 3}

7. There hath never yet arisen in Israel a prophet like unto Moses, one who hath beheld his similitude,

8. The Law of truth God gave unto his people by the hand of his prophet who was faithful in his house.

9. God will not alter nor change his Law to everlasting for any other.

10. He watcheth and knoweth our secret thoughts: he beholdeth the end of a thing before it existeth.

11. He bestoweth lovingkindness upon a man according to his work; he giveth to the wicked evil according to his wickedness.

12. He will send our anointed at the end of days, to redeem them that wait for the end—his salvation.

13. In the abundance of his lovingkindness God will quicken the dead. Blessed for evermore be his glorious name.

He is Lord of the universe, who reigned ere any creature yet was formed:

At the time when all things were made by his desire, then was his name proclaimed King.

And after all things shall have had an end, he alone, the dreaded one, shall reign;

Who was, who is, and who will be in glory.

And he is One, and there is no second to compare to him, to consort with him:

Without beginning, without end: to him belong strength and dominion.

And he is my God—my Redeemer liveth—and a rock in my travail in time of distress;

And he is my banner and my refuge, the portion of my cup on the day when I call.

Into his hand I commend my spirit, when I sleep and when I wake:

And with my spirit, my body also: the Lord is with me, and I will not fear.

{p. 4}

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and given us command concerning the washing of the hands.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast formed man in wisdom, and created in him many orifices and vessels. It is revealed and known before the throne of thy glory, that if one of these be opened, or one of those be closed, it would be impossible to exist and to stand before thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who healest all flesh and doest wondrously.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and commanded us to occupy ourselves with the words of the Law.

Make pleasant, therefore, we beseech thee, O Lord our God, the words of thy Law in our mouth and in the mouth of thy people, the house of Israel, so that we with our offspring and the offspring of thy people, the house of Israel, may all know thy name and learn thy Law. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who teachest the Law to thy people Israel.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from all nations and given us thy Law. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who givest the Law.

{p. 5}

The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.

Mishnah. Treatise Peah, ch. i.

These are the things which have no fixed measure (by enactment of the Law): the corners of the field, the first fruits, the offerings brought on appearing before the Lord at the three festivals, the practice of charity and the study of the Law.—These are the things, the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the stock remains for him for the world to come: viz., honoring father and mother, the practice of charity, timely attendance at the house of study morning and evening, hospitality to wayfarers, visiting the sick, dowering the bride, attending the dead to the grave, devotion in prayer, and making peace between man and his fellow; but the study of the Law is equal to them all.

O my God, the soul which thou gavest me is pure; thou didst create it, thou didst form it, thou didst breathe it into me; thou preservest it within me; and thou wilt take it from me, but wilt restore it unto me hereafter. So long as the soul is within me, I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, Sovereign of all works, Lord of all souls! Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest souls unto dead bodies.

{p. 6}

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the un verse, who hast given to the cock intelligence to distinguish between day and night.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast not made me a heathen.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast not made me a bondman.

Men say:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast not made me a woman.

Women say:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast made me according to thy will.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who openest the eyes of the blind.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who clothest the naked.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who loosest them that are bound.

{p. 7}

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who raisest up them that are bowed down.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who spreadest forth the earth above the waters.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast supplied my every want.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast made firm the steps of man.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who girdest Israel with might.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the. universe, who crownest Israel with glory.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who givest strength to the weary.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who removest sleep from mine eyes and slumber from mine eyelids.

And may it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to make us familiar with thy Law, and to make us cleave to thy commandments,

{p. 8}

{cont}O lead us not into the power of sin, or of transgression or iniquity, or of temptation, or of scorn: let not the evil inclination have sway over us: keep us far from a bad man and a bad companion: make us cleave to the good inclination and to good works: subdue our inclination so that it may submit itself unto thee; and let us obtain this day, and every day, grace, favor and mercy in thine eyes, and in the eyes of all who behold us; and bestow lovingkindnesses upon us. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who bestowest lovingkindnesses upon thy people Israel.

May it be thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, to deliver me this day, and every day, from arrogant men and from arrogance, from a bad mar., from a bad companion and from a bad neighbor, and from any mishap, and from the adversary that destroyeth; from a hard judgment, and from a hard opponent, whether he be a son of the covenant or be not a son or the covenant.

At all times let a man fear God as well in private as in public, acknowledge the truth, and speak the truth in his heart; and let him rise early and say:

Sovereign of all worlds! Not because of our righteous acts do we lay our supplications before thee, but because of thine abundant mercies. What are we? What is our life? What is our piety? What our righteousness?

{p. 9}

What our helpfulness? What our strength? What our might? What shall we say before thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nought before thee, the men of renown as though they had not been, the wise as if without knowledge, and the men of understanding as if without discernment? For most of their works are void, and the days of their lives are vanity before thee, and the pre-eminence of man over the beast is nought, for all is vanity.

Nevertheless we are thy people, the children of thy covenant, the children of Abraham, thy friend, to whom thou didst swear on Mount Moriah; the seed of Isaac, his only son, who was bound upon the altar the congregation of Jacob, thy first barn son, whose name thou didst call Israel and Jeshurun by reason of the love wherewith thou didst love him, and the joy wherewith thou didst rejoice in him.

It is, therefore, our duty to thank, praise and glorify thee, to bless, to sanctify and to offer praise and thanksgiving unto thy name. Happy are we! how goodly is our portion, and how pleasant is our lot, and how beautiful our heritage! Happy are we who, early and late, morning and evening, twice every day, declare:

Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One. Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.

{p. 10}

Thou wast the same ere the world was created; thou hast been the same since the world hath been created; thou art the same in this world, and thou wilt be the same in the world to come. Sanctify thy name upon them that sanctify it, yea, sanctify thy name throughout thy world; and through thy salvation let our horn be exalted and raised on high. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest thy name amongst the many,

Thou art the Lord our God in heaven and on earth, and in the highest heaven of heavens. Verily thou art the first and thou art the last, and beside thee there is no God. O gather them that hope for thee from the four corners of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that thou art God, thou alone, over all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou hast made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is therein; and which among all the works of thy hands, whether among those above or among those beneath, can say unto thee, What doest thou? Our Father who art in heaven, deal kindly with us for the sake of thy great name by which we are called; and fulfil unto us, O Lord our God, that which is written, At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you

{p. 11}

a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.

Numbers xxviii. 1–8.

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in its due season. And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the Lord; he-lambs of the first year without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering. The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even; and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai f or a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink offering of strong drink unto the Lord. And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.

Leviticus i. 11.

And he shall slay it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.

{p. 12}

On Sabbath the following is added:—

Numbers xxviii. 9, 10.

And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof.

On New Moon the following is added:—

Numbers xxviii. 11–15.

And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish; and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram; and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering unto every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of an hin for the ram, and the fourth part of an hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year. And one the-goat for a sin offering unto the Lord; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof.

Mishnah, Treatise Zebachim, ch. v.

1. Which are the places where the sacrifices were offered?—Those that were most holy were slain on the north side of the altar: the bull and the he-goat of the Day of Atonement were slain on the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side, and had to be sprinkled between the staves of the ark, and towards the veil, and upon the golden altar: one of these sprinklings omitted rendered the whole ceremony invalid. The remaining blood the priest poured out at the western base of the outer altar; if, however, he did not do so, the omission did not render the ceremony invalid.

2. The bulls and he-goats which were to be wholly burnt. were slain on the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side, and had to be sprinkled towards the veil and upon the golden altar: one of these sprinklings omitted rendered the whole ceremony invalid. The remaining blood the priest poured out at the western base of the outer altar; if, however, he failed to do so, it did not render the ceremony invalid: both these and the preceding offerings were burnt in the repository of ashes.

3. The sin offerings of the congregation and of the individual.—These are the sin offerings of the congregation: the he-goats offered on the new moon and on the festivals. They were slain on the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side, and of this blood four sprinklings had to be made, one upon each of the four corners of the altar. How was this done? The priest went up the ascent, passed on to the middle terrace that surrounded the altar, and came successively to the

{p. 14}

south-east, the north-east, the north-west and the south-west corners. The remaining blood he poured out at the southern base of the altar. These sacrifices might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by the males of the priesthood, within the hangings of the court, the same day and evening until midnight.

4. The burnt offering belonged to the class of the most holy. It was slain on the north side; its blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side; and of its blood two sprinklings had to be made (at opposite angles of the altar) so as to constitute four, (a portion of the blood thus reaching each of the four sides of the altar). This offering had also to be flayed, dismembered and totally consumed by fire.

5. The peace offerings of the congregation and the trespass offerings.—These are the trespass offerings: the trespass offerings for robbery, for profane appropriation of sanctified objects, for carnally knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage; the trespass offering of a Nazirite who has become defiled by a dead body; the trespass offering of a leper at his cleansing; the trespass offering of one who is in doubt whether he has committed an act that has to be atoned for by a sin offering. All these were slain on the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side; and of their blood two sprinklings had to be made at the altar in such a manner as to constitute four. These sacrifices might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by the males of the priesthood, within the hangings of the court, the same day and evening until midnight.

6. The thank offering and the ram of the Nazirite were holy in a minor degree. They might be slain in any part of the court, of their blood two sprinklings

{p. 15}

had to be made at the altar in such a manner as to constitute four; and they might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by any person, in any part of the city, the same day and until midnight. To the portions thereof belonging to the priests the same rule 'applied as to the rest, except that the former might only be eaten by the priests, their wives, their children and their slaves.

7. The peace offerings were also holy in a minor degree. They might be slain in any part of the court; of their blood two sprinklings had to be made at the altar in such a manner as to constitute four, and they might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by any person, in any part of the city, during two days and one night. To the portions thereof belonging to the priests the same rule applied as to the rest, except that the former might only be eaten by the priests, their wives, their children and their slaves.

8. The first-born, the tithe of cattle and the paschal lamb were likewise holy in a minor degree. They might be slain in any part of the court; only one sprinkling of their blood had to be made; this, however, had to be done towards the base of the altar. In respect to their consumption the following differences prevailed: the first-born might be eaten only by the priests, while the tithe might be eaten by any person: both might be eaten, dressed after any manner, in any part of the city, during two days and one night. The paschal lamb might only be eaten the same evening until midnight; it might be partaken of by none but the previously appointed number of persons, and it might only be eaten roasted.

Boraitha d’R. Ishmael.

$Rabbi Ishmael says: There are thirteen exegetical principles/$

{p. 16}

$by which the Law is expounded:—1. The inference from minor to major. 2. The inference from a similarity of phrases. 3. A general law may be derived by induction from different cases which, occurring in the same or in different verses, have yet some feature in common. 4. A general proposition followed by the enumeration of particulars already comprehended in the general proposition, (in which case the scope of the proposition is limited by the things specified) 5. An enumeration of particulars followed by a general proposition in which they are also comprehended, (in which case the scope of the proposition extends also to the things not specified). 6. Two general propositions, separated from each other by an enumeration of particulars, include only such things as are similar to those specified 7. An inference drawn from a general proposition complemented by a particular term, and an inference drawn from a particular term complemented by a general proposition. 8. If anything is included in a general proposition and is then made the subject of a special statement, that which is predicated of it is not to be understood as limited to itself alone, but is to be applied to the whole of the general proposition 9. If anything is included in a general proposition, and is then singled out in order to be made the subject of a special statement, similar to the general proposition, this particularisation is intended, so far as its subject is concerned, to lessen and not to add to its restrictions. 10. If anything is included in a general proposition, and is then singled out in order to be made the subject of a special statement, not similar to the general proposition, this particularisation is intended in some respects to lessen and in others to add to its restrictions. 11. If anything is included in a general proposition, and is then made the subject of a fresh statement (not in harmony with the former), the terms of the general proposition will not apply to it, unless the Scripture distinctly indicates that they shall apply. 12. The meaning of a passage may be deduced from its context, or from some subsequent passage. 13. Similarly, when two passages are in contradiction to each other, the explanation can be determined only when a third text is found, capable of harmonizing the two./$

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

{p. 17}

Before putting on the Tallith, say the following:—

I am here enwrapping myself in this fringed robe, in fulfilment of the command of my Creator, as it is written in the Law, They shall make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments throughout their generations. And even as I cover myself with the Tallith in this world, so may my soul deserve to be clothed with a beauteous spiritual robe in the world to come, in the garden of Eden. Amen.

On putting on the Tallith, say:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast commanded us to enwrap ourselves in the fringed garment.

How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. They sate themselves with the fatness of thy house; and thou givest them to drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light do we see light. O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

Meditation before laying the Tephillin.

I am here intent upon the act of laying the Tephillin, in fulfilment of the command of my Creator, who hath commanded us to lay the Tephillin, as it is written in the Law, And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. Within these Tephillin are placed four sections of the Law,{fr. *} that declare the absolute

{fn. *. Deut. vi. 4–9; xi. 13–21; Exod. xiii. 1–10; 11–16.}

{p. 18}

unity of God, and that remind us of the miracles and wonders which he wrought for us when he brought us forth from Egypt, even he who hath power over the highest and the lowest to deal with them according to his will. He hath commanded us to lay the Tephillin upon the hand as a memorial of his outstretched arm; opposite the heart, to indicate the duty of subjecting the longings and designs of our heart to his service, blessed be he; and upon the head over against the brain, thereby teaching that the mind, whose seat is in the brain, together with all senses and faculties, is to be subjected to his service, blessed be he. May the effect of the precept thus observed be to extend to me long life with sacred influences and holy thoughts, free from every approach, even in imagination, to sin and iniquity. May the evil inclination not mislead or entice us, but may we be led to serve the Lord as it is in our hearts to do. Amen.

On placing the Tephillah on the arm, say:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast commanded us to lay the Tephillin.

On placing the Tephillah on the forehead, say:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning the precept of the Tephillin.

$Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever./$

{p. 19}

The Retsuah is placed thrice round the middle finger, and the following is said:—

And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercy: I will even betroth thee to me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord.

In some Congregations Psalm xxx (page {prr. 103}) is said here.

~hr

Blessed be he who spake, and the world existed: blessed be he: blessed be he who was the maker of the world in the beginning: blessed be he who speaketh and doeth: blessed be he who decreeth and performeth: blessed be he who hath mercy upon the earth: blessed be he who hath mercy upon his creatures: blessed be he who payeth a good reward to them that fear him: blessed be he who liveth for ever, and endureth to eternity: blessed be he who redeemeth and delivereth: blessed be his name.—Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, O God and merciful Father, praised by the mouth of thy people, lauded and glorified by the tongue of thy loving ones and thy servants. We also will praise thee, O Lord our God, with the songs of David thy servant; with praises and psalms we will magnify, laud and glorify thee, and we will make mention of thy name, and proclaim thee our King, O our

{p. 20}

{cont}God, thou the only one, the life of all worlds. O King, praised and glorified be thy great name for ever and ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, a King extolled with praises.

1 Chron. xvi. 8–36.

O give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name; make known his doings among the peoples. Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; tell ye of all his marvellous works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Search ye for the Lord and his strength; seek ye his face evermore. Remember his marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; O ye seed of Israel, his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth. Remember his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; (the covenant) which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant: saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, as the lot of your inheritance: when ye were but a few men in number; yea, few, and sojourners in it; and they went about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people. He suffered no man to oppress them; yea, he rebuked kings for their sakes; (saying), Touch not mine

{p. 21}

anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm. Sing unto the Lord, all the earth; proclaim his salvation from day to day. Recount his glory among the nations, his marvels among all the peoples. For great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; but the Lord made the heavens. Grandeur and majesty are before him: strength and gladness are in his place. Give unto the Lord, ye families of the peoples, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: take an offering, and come before him: worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. Tremble before him all the earth; the world also is set firm, that it cannot be moved. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigneth. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; let the plain exult, and all that is therein. Then shall the trees of the forest exult before the Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness endureth forever. And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord.

Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool;

{p. 22}

holy is he. Exalt ye the Lord our God, aim worship at his holy mount; for the Lord our God is holy. And he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up all his wrath. Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. Ascribe ye strength unto God: his majesty is over Israel, and his strength is in the skies. O God, thou art to be feared out of thy holy places: the God of Israel he giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God. O God of vengeance, Lord, O God of vengeance, shine forth. Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render to the proud their desert. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing be upon thy people. (Selah.) The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah. ) O Lord of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee. Save, .Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them, and carry them for ever Our soul waiteth for the Lord: he is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. Let thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped for thee. Show us thy lovingkindness, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. Rise up for our help and set

{p. 23}

us free for thy lovingkindness’ sake. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open wide thy mouth and I will fill it. Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy is the people, whose God is the Lord. And as for me, I have trusted in thy lovingkindness; my heart shall be glad in thy salvation: I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.

The following Psalm is omitted on Sabbaths, Holydays, the day before Passover, the Intermediate days of Passover, and on the day before the Day of Atonement.

Psalm c.

A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout for joy unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with joy: come before him with exulting. Know ye that the Lord he is God: he hath made us, and we are his, his people and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: give thanks unto him, bless his name. For the Lord is good; his lovingkindness is everlasting; and his faithfulness from generation to generation.

On Weekdays continue "Let the glory," etc., {pr. 33}.

On Sabbaths and Holydays, and on Hoshana Rabba, the following Psalms are said:—

Psalm xix.

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens recount the glory of God, and the firmament declareth his handiwork. Day unto day poureth forth speech, and night unto night proclaimeth knowledge.

{p. 24}

{cont}There is no speech nor language; their voice cannot be heard. Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world; in them hath he set a tent for the sun. And he is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from his heat.—The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments of the Lord are truthful, righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: in keeping them there is great reward. Who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be blameless, and I shall be clear from great transgression. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

Psalm xxxiv.

$A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed./$

I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

{p. 25}

My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the meek shall hear and rejoice.

O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.

I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.

They looked unto him. and shone with joy: and their faces shall not be confounded.

This sufferer cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.

The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.

O taste and see that the Lord is good: happy is the man that taketh refuge in him.

O fear the Lord, ye his holy ones: for there is no want to them that fear him.

Young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good.

Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.

What man is he that delighteth in life, and loveth many days that he may see good?

Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile.

Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.

The eyes of the Lord are towards the righteous, and his ears are towards their cry.

The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.

(The righteous) cry, and the Lord hearkeneth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.

The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.

{p. 26}

Many are the evil fortunes of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.

He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

Evil shall slay the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be condemned.

The Lord setteth free the soul of his servants; and none that take refuge in. him shall be condemned.

Psalm xc.

A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. O Lord, thou hast been a dwelling place unto us in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou gavest birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God. Thou turnest man back to dust, and sayest, Return, ye children of men. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are in a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which sprouteth afresh. In the morning it bloometh and sprouteth afresh; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. For we are consumed by thine anger, and in thy wrath are we confounded. Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. For all our days have passed away in thy wrath, we bring our years to an end like a sound. The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years; yet is their pride but travail and nothingness; for it is soon gone by, and we fly away. Who knoweth the power of thine anger, and thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee? So teach us to number our days, that we may get us a heart of wisdom. Return, O Lord; how long?—and repent thee concerning thy

{p. 27}

servants. O satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness; that we may exult and rejoice all our days. Make us rejoice according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, the years wherein we have seen evil. Let thy work be made manifest unto thy servants, and thy majesty upon their children.

And let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.

Psalm xci.

He that dwelleth in the shelter of the Most High abideth under the shadow of the Almighty. I say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.—For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his pinions, and under his wings shalt thou take refuge: his truth shall be a shield and a buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flieth by day; of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor of the plague that ravageth at noon day. A thousand may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; it shall not come nigh unto thee. Only .with thine eyes shalt thou look on, and see the retribution of the wicked.—For thou, O Lord, art my refuge.—Thou hast made the Most High thy dwelling place; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any scourge come nigh thy tent. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy . ways. They shall bear thee upon their hands, lest thou strike thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; upon the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample.—Because he hath set his love upon me,

{p. 28}

therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name. When he calleth upon me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him and honor him. With length of days will I satisfy him, and will let him see my salvation.

Repeat the last verse.

Psalm cxxxv.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord: ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Praise ye the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. Whatsoever the Lord pleaseth, that doeth he, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps. He causeth vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. It is he who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. It is he who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: and gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself concerning his servants,

{p. 29}

The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak. not; eyes have they, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. They that make them shall become like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord: O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord: O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord: ye that fear the Lord, bless ye the Lord. Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxxxvi.

O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him who alone doeth great marvels: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him that by understanding made the heavens: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him that spread forth the earth above the waters: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him that made great lights: for his loving kindness endureth for ever.

The sun to rule by day: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

The moon and stars to rule by night: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him that smote the Egyptians in their first born: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And brought out Israel from among them: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

{p. 30}

With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him who parted the Red Sea in sunder: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him who led his people through the wilderness: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him who smote great kings; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And slew mighty kings: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

Sihon king of the Amorites: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And Og king of Bashan: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And gave their land for an heritage: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

Even an heritage under Israel his servant: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

Who remembered us in our low estate: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And hath released us from our adversaries: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

He giveth food to all flesh: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

Psalm xxxiii.

Exult in the Lord, O ye righteous: praise is seemly for the upright. Give thanks unto the Lord with the lyre; sing praises unto him with the harp of ten strings. Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with shouts of joy. For the word of the Lord is right; and all his work is done in faithfulness. He loveth righteousness

{p. 31}

and justice: the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the Lord. By the word of the Lord the heavens were made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: he layeth up the floods in store-houses. Let all the earth fear the Lord: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spake, and it was; he commanded, and it stood fast. The Lord hath frustrated the design of the nations; he hath foiled the thoughts of the peoples. The counsel of the Lord standeth fast for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. Happy is the nation whose god is the Lord; the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. The Lord looketh down from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men; from the place of his habitation he gazeth upon all the inhabitants of the earth; he that fashioneth the hearts of them all, that giveth heed to all their works. A king is not saved by greatness of power: a mighty man is not delivered by greatness of strength. A horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he rescue any by his great power. Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope for his lovingkindness to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waiteth for the Lord: he is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. Let thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped for thee.

Psalm xcii.

A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath Day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: to declare thy lovingkindness

{p. 32}

in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, with an instrument of ten strings and with a harp, with thoughtful music upon the lyre. For thou, O Lord, hast made me rejoice through thy work: I will exult in the work of thy hands. How great are thy works, O Lord: thy thoughts are very deep. A brutish man knoweth it not, neither doth a fool understand this: when the wicked sprang up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity flourished, it was that they might be destroyed for ever. But thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. But my horn hast thou exalted, like that of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies; mine ears have heard my desire of them that rose up against me, doers of evil. The righteous shall spring up like a palm-tree; he shall grow tall like a cedar in Lebanon. Planted in the house of the Lord, they shall blossom in the courts of our God. They shall still shoot forth in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to declare that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

Psalm xciii.

The Lord reigneth; he hath robed him in majesty; the Lord hath robed him, yea, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is set firm, that it cannot be moved. Thy throne is set firm from of old: thou art from everlasting. The streams have lifted up, O Lord, the streams have lifted tip their voice; the streams lift up their roaring. Than the voices of many waters, mighty waters, breakers of the sea, more mighty is the Lord on high.

{p. 33}

{cont}Thy testimonies are very faithful: holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for evermore.

On Weekdays continue here from {pr. 23}.

Let the glory of the Lord endure for ever; let the Lord rejoice in his works. Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof the Lord's name is to be praised. The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations. The Lord hath established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigneth. The Lord reigneth; the Lord hath reigned; the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of his land. The Lord hath frustrated the design of the nations; he hath foiled the thoughts of the peoples. Many are the thoughts in a man's heart; but the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand. The counsel of the Lord standeth fast for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. For he spake, and it was; he commanded, and it stood fast. For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, Israel for his peculiar treasure. For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. And he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth

{p. 34}

not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up all his wrath. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call.

Happy are they that dwell in thy house: they will be ever praising thee. (Selah.)

Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy is the people, whose God is the Lord.

Psalm cxlv. A Psalm of Praise: of David.

I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.

Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.

Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised: and his greatness is unsearchable.

One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.

On the majestic glory of thy splendor, and on thy marvellous deeds, will I meditate.

And men shall speak of the might of thy awful acts; and I will recount thy greatness.

They shall pour forth the fame of thy great goodness and shall exult in thy righteousness.

The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow to anger and of great lovingkindness.

The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.

All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and thy loving ones shall bless thee.

They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.

{p. 35}

To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the majestic glory of his kingdom.

Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down.

The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in due season.

Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest every living thing with favor.

The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and loving in all his works.

The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him. to all that call upon him in truth.

He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry and will save them.

The Lord guardeth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.

My mouth shall speak of the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.

But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxlvi.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul: I will praise the Lord, while I live; I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being. Put not your trust

{p. 36}

in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no help, When his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his designs perish. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord, his God: who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is therein; who keepeth truth for ever; who executeth judgment for the oppressed; who giveth food to the hungry: the Lord looseth the prisoners; the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind; the Lord raiseth up them that are bowed down; the Lord loveth the righteous; the Lord guardeth the strangers; he upholdeth the fatherless and widow; but the way of the wicked he maketh crooked. The Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxlvii.

Praise ye the Lord; for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant, and praise is seemly. The Lord doth build up Jerusalem; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. He counteth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; his understanding is infinite. The Lord upholdeth the meek; he abaseth the wicked to the ground. Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praises upon the lyre unto our God: who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to sprout upon the mountains; who giveth to the beast its food,

{p. 37}

and to the young ravens which cry. He deligheth not in the strength of the horse, he taketh no pleasure in the vigor of a man. The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope for his lovingkindness. Extol the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. He maketh peace in thy borders; he satisfieth thee with the fat of wheat. He sendeth out his commandment to the earth; his word runneth very swiftly. He giveth snow like wool; he scattereth hoar frost like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. He declareth his words unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they do not know them. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxlviii

Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels; praise ye him, all his host. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord: for he commanded, and they were created. He hath established them for ever and ever: he gave a decree which none shall transgress. Praise the Lord from the earth,

{p. 38}

ye sea-monsters and all deeps: fire and hail, snow and smoke; stormy wind, fulfilling his word: mountains and all hills; fruit trees and all cedars: wild beasts and all cattle; creeping things and winged birds: kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges of the earth: both young men and maidens; old men and children: let them praise the name of the Lord; for his name alone is exalted: his majesty is above the earth and heaven. And he hath lifted up a horn for his people, to the praise of all his loving ones: even of the children of Israel, the people near unto him: praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxlix.

Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song; his praise in the assembly of those that love him. Let Israel rejoice in his Maker: let the children of Zion be glad in their King. Let them praise his name with the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and lyre. For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he adorneth the meek with salvation. Let those that love him triumph in glory: let them exult upon their beds. High praises of God are in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples: to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this is an honor for all his loving ones. Praise ye the Lord.

{p. 39}

Psalm cl.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his abundant greatness. Praise him with the blast of the horn: praise him with the harp and the lyre. Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and the pipe. Praise him with the clear-toned cymbals; praise him with the loud-sounding cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord: praise ye the Lord.

The last verse is repeated.

Blessed he the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen. Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, who dwelleth in Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord. Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone doeth wondrous things: and blessed be his glorious name for ever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen.

The following to "worship thee," {pr. 40}, is said standing.

1 Chron. xxix. 10–13.

And David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the congregation: and David said, Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of Israel our father, from everlasting to everlasting. Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine, O Lord, is the kingdom, and the supremacy as head over all. Riches

{p. 40}

and honor come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thine hand are might and power; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. Now, therefore, our God, we give thanks unto thee, and praise thy glorious name.

Nehemiah ix. 6–11.

Thou art the Lord, even thou alone; thou hast made the heavens, the heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou givest life to them all; and the host of heaven worship thee. Thou art the Lord the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham: and foundest his heart faithful before thee:

And thou madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous. And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; and shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt arrogantly against them; and didst make thee a name, as it is this day.

{p. 41}

{cont}And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.

Exod. xiv. 30–xv. 18.

Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. And Israel saw the great power which the Lord put forth against the Egyptians, and the people feared the Lord: and they believed in the Lord, and in Moses his servant.

Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying: I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath been highly exalted: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: this is my God, and I will glorify him; my father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name. Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: and his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. The floods cover them: they went down into the depths like a stone. Thy right hand, O Lord, that is glorious in power, thy right hand, O Lord, dasheth in pieces the enemy. And in the greatness of thy majesty thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: thou sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble. And with the

{p. 42}

blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up, the streams stood upright as an heap; the floods were congealed in the heart of the sea. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil: my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the mighty ones: who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, revered in praises, doing marvels? Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people which thou hast redeemed: thou has guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation. The peoples have heard it; they tremble: pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia. Then were the dukes of Edom confounded; the mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold of them: all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. Terror and dread falleth upon them: by the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, which thou hast acquired. Thou wilt bring them in, and plan them in the mountain of thine inheritance, the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established. The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is ruler over the nations. And saviors shall come up

{p. 43}

on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's. And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One. And in thy Law it is written, saying, Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

On Sabbaths and Holydays continue here "The breath," etc., {pr. 182}.

Praised be thy name for ever, O our King, the great and holy God and King, in heaven and on earth; for unto thee, O Lord our God, and God of our fathers, song and praise are becoming, hymn and psalm, strength and dominion, victory, greatness and might, renown and glory, holiness and sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings from henceforth even for ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, God and King, great in praises, God of thanksgivings, Lord of wonders, who makest choice of song and psalm, O King and God, the life of all worlds.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who formest light and createst darkness, who makest peace and createst all things:

{p. 45}

Who in mercy givest light to the earth and to them that dwell thereon and in thy goodness renewest the creation every day continually. How manifold are thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy possessions. O King, who alone wast exalted from aforetime, praised, glorified and extolled from days of old; O everlasting God, in thine abundant mercies, have mercy upon us, Lord of our strength, Rock of our stronghold. Shield of our salvation, thou Stronghold of ours!

The blessed God, great in knowledge, prepared and formed the rays of the sun: it was a boon he produced as a glory to his name: he set the luminaries round about his strength. The chiefs of his hosts are holy beings that exalt the Almighty, and continually declare the glory of God and his holiness. Be thou blessed, O Lord our God, for the excellency of thy handiwork, and for the bright luminaries which thou hast made: they shall glorify thee for ever.

Be thou blessed, O our Rock, our King and Redeemer, Creator of holy beings, praised be thy name for ever, O our King; Creator of ministering spirits, all of whom stand in the heights of the universe, and proclaim with awe in unison aloud the words of the living God and everlasting King. All of them are beloved, pure and mighty; and all of them in dread and awe do the will of their Master; and all of

{p. 46}

them open their mouths in holiness and purity, with song and psalm, while they bless and praise, glorify and reverence, sanctify and ascribe sovereignty to—

The name of the Divine King, the great, mighty and dreaded One, holy is he; and they all take upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven one from the other, and give sanction to one another to hallow their Creator: in tranquil joy of spirit, with pure speech and holy melody they all respond in unison, and exclaim with awe:

~Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory./~

And the Ophanim and the holy Chayoth with a noise of great rushing, upraising themselves towards the Seraphim, thus over against them offer praise and say:

~Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place./~

To the blessed God they offer pleasant melodies; to the King, the living and ever-enduring God, they utter hymns and make their praises heard; for he alone performeth mighty deeds, and maketh new things; he is the Lord of battles; he soweth righteousness, causeth salvation to spring forth, createth remedies, and is revered in praises. He is the Lord of wonders, who in his goodness reneweth

{p. 47}

the creation every day continually; as it is said, (O give thanks) to him that maketh great lights, for his lovingkindness endureth for ever. O cause a new light to shine upon Zion, and may we all be worthy soon to enjoy its brightness. Blessed art thou, O Lord, Creator of the luminaries.

With abounding love hast thou loved us, O Lord our God, with great and exceeding pity hast thou pitied us. O our Father, our King, for our fathers’ sake, who trusted in thee, and whom thou didst teach the statutes of life, be also gracious unto us and teach us. O our Father, merciful Father, ever compassionate, have mercy upon us; O put it into our hearts to understand and to discern, to mark, learn and teach, to heed, to do and to fulfil in love all the words of instruction in thy Law. Enlighten our eyes in thy Law, and let our hearts cleave to thy commandments, and unite our hearts to love and fear thy name, so that we be never put to shame. Because we have trusted in thy holy, great and revered name, we shall rejoice and he glad in thy salvation. O bring us in peace from the four corners of the earth, and make us go upright to our land; for thou art a God who worketh salvation. Thou hast chosen us from all peoples and tongues, and hast brought us near unto thy great name for ever

{p. 48}

in faithfulness, that we might in love give thanks unto thee and proclaim thy unity. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast chosen thy people Israel in love.

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which. I command thee this day, shall be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sit-test in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.

Deut. xi. 13–21.

And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I

{p. 49}

command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and. with all your soul, that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. And I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; and the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them when thou sittest in

{p. 50}

thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.

Numbers xv. 37–41.

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each corner a cord of blue: and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray: that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your God, who

{p. 51}

brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.

$True and firm, established and enduring, right and faithful, beloved and precious, desirable and pleasant, revered and mighty, well-ordered and acceptable, good and beautiful is this thy word unto us for ever and ever. It is true, the God of the universe is our King, the Rock of Jacob, the Shield of our salvation: thoughout all generations he endureth and his name endureth; his throne is established, and his kingdom and his faithfulness endure for ever. His words also live and endure; they are faithful and desirable for ever and to all eternity, as for our fathers so also for us, our children, our generations, and for all the generations of the seed of Israel his servants.

For the first and for the last ages thy word is good and endureth for ever and ever; it is true and trustworthy, a statute which shall not pass away. True it is that thou art indeed the Lord our God, and the God of our fathers, our King, our fathers’ King, our Redeemer, the Redeemer of our fathers, our Maker, the Rock of our salvation; our Deliverer and Rescuer from everlasting, such is thy name; there is no God beside thee./$

{p. 52}

Thou hast been the help of our fathers from of old, a Shield and Saviour to their children after them in every generation: in the heights of the universe is thy habitation, and thy judgments and thy righteousness reach to the furthest ends of the earth. Happy is the man who hearkeneth unto thy commandments, and layeth up thy Law and thy word in his heart. True it is that thou art indeed the Lord of thy people, and a mighty King to plead their cause. True it is that thou art indeed the first and thou art the last, and beside thee we have no King, Redeemer and Saviour. From Egypt thou didst redeem us, O Lord our God, and from the house of bondmen thou didst deliver us; all their first born thou didst slay, but thy first-born thou didst redeem; thou didst divide the Red Sea, and drown the proud; but thou madest the beloved to pass through, while the waters covered their adversaries, not one of whom was left. Wherefore the beloved praised and extolled God, and offered hymns, songs, praises, blessings and thanksgivings to the King and God, who liveth and endureth; who is high and exalted, great and revered; who bringeth low the haughty, and raiseth up the lowly, leadeth forth the prisoners, delivereth the meek, helpeth the poor, and answereth his people when they cry unto him; even praises to the Most High God, blessed is he, and ever to be blessed. Moses and the children of Israel sang a song unto thee with great joy, saying, all of them,

{p. 53}

Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the might ones? Who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness revered in praises, doing marvels?

With a new song the redeemed people offered praise unto thy name at the sea shore: they all gave thanks in unison, and proclaimed thy, sovereignty, and said,

The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

O Rock of Israel, arise to the help of Israel, and deliver, according to thy promise, Judah and Israel. Our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast redeemed Israel.

Legions have devoured her; worshippers of strange gods have possessed her: they have put thy people Israel to the sword, and in wilfulness have slain the loving ones of the Most High. Therefore let Zion weep bitterly, and Jerusalem give forth her voice. O my heart, my heart! how it grieveth for the slain! My bowels, my bowels! how they yearn for the slain! For thou, O Lord, didst consume her with fire; and with fire thou wilt in future restore her, as it is said, As for me, I will be unto her, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and I will be a glory in the midst of her.

$In the days of Mordecai and Esther, in Shushan the capital, when the wicked Haman rose up against them, and sought to destroy, to slay and make to perish all the Jews, both young and old, little children and women, on one day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,—then didst thou in thine abundant mercy bring his counsel to nought, didst frustrate his design, and return his recompense upon his own head; and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows./$

For all these things thy name, O our King, shall be continually blessed and exalted for ever and ever.

During the Ten Days of Penitence say:—

$O inscribe all the children of thy covenant for a happy life./$

And everything that liveth shall give thanks unto thee for ever, and shall praise thy name in truth, O God, our salvation and our help. Blessed art thou, O Lord, whose name is All-good, and unto whom it is becoming to give thanks.

At the repetition of the Amidah by the Reader, the following is introduced:—

$Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the three-fold blessing of thy Law written by the hand of Moses thy servant, which was spoken by Aaron and his sons, the priests, thy holy people, as it is said, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace./$

Grant peace, welfare, blessing, grace, loving kindness and mercy unto us and unto all Israel, thy people. Bless us, O our Father, even all of us together, with the light of thy countenance for by the light of thy countenance thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the Law of life, lovingkindness and righteousness, blessing, mercy, life and peace; and may it be good in thy sight to bless thy people Israel at all times and in every hour with thy peace.

During the Ten Days of Penitence say:—

$In the book of life, blessing, peace and good sustenance may we be remembered and inscribed before thee, we and all thy people the house of Israel, for a happy life and for peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest peace./$

{p. 66}

~Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace./~

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul. be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

In illness, or when time is lacking, the following shortened form of the Amidah may be said:—

$"O Lord," {pr. 53}, to "holy God," {pr. 55}.

Give us understanding, O Lord our God, to know thy ways; circumcise our hearts to fear thee, and forgive us so that we may be redeemed. Keep us far from sorrow; satiate us on the pastures of thy land, and gather our scattered ones from the four corners of the earth. Let them that go astray be judged according to thy will, and wave thy hand over the wicked. Let the righteous rejoice in the rebuilding of thy city, and in the establishment of thy temple, and in the flourishing of the horn of David thy servant, and in the clear-shining light of the son of Jesse, thine anointed. Even before we call, do thou answer. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hearkenest unto prayer./$

On Mondays and Thursdays the following is said to "the Lord is One," {pr. 76}. On other Week Days continue, "And David said," etc., {pr. 76}. Both these Prayers are omitted on New Moon, during the whole month of Nisan, on the thirty-third day of Counting the Omer, from the first day of Sivan until the second day after Pentecost, on the 9th and 15th of Ab, on the day before New Year, from the day before the Fast of Atonement until the second day after Tabernacles, on the Feast of Dedication, on the 15th of Shebat, on the two days of Purim, and on the two days of Purim Katon, the 14th and 15th of Adar Rishon. These prayers are also omitted in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, and at the celebration of a circumcision.

And he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away and cloth not stir up all his wrath. Withhold

{p. 71}

not thou thy tender mercies from us, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve us. Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from amongst the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. If thou shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. Not according to our sins wilt thou deal with us, nor requite us according to our iniquities. If our iniquities testify against us, work thou, O Lord, for thy name's sake. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. May the Lord answer us in the day of trouble, the name of the God of Jacob set us up on high. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Our Father, our King, be gracious unto us and answer us, for we have no good works of our own; deal with us in charity for thy name's sake. Our Lord, our God, hearken to the voice of our supplications, and remember unto us the covenant of our fathers, and save us for thy name's sake. And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast made thee a name as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. O Lord, according to all thy righteous acts, let thine anger and thy fury, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us. Now therefore, hearken, O our God, unto the prayer

{p. 72}

of thy servant and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.

Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not lay our supplications before thee because of our righteous acts, but because of thine abundant mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not; for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name. O our Father, merciful Father, show us a sign for good, and gather our scattered ones from the four corners of the earth. Let all the nations perceive and know that thou art the Lord our God. And now, O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou art our potter, yea, we are all the work of thy hand. Save us for thy name's sake, our Rock, our King, and our Redeemer. Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine inheritance over to reproach, that the nations should make a by-word of them. Wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God? We know that we have sinned, and there is none to stand up in our behalf; let thy great name stand for our defence in time of trouble. We know that we have no good works of our own; deal with us in charity for thy name's sake. As a father hath mercy upon his children, so, O Lord, have mercy upon us, and save us for thy name's sake. Have pity upon

{p. 73}

thy people; have mercy upon thine inheritance; spare, we pray thee, according to the abundance of thy tender mercies; be gracious unto us and answer us, for charity is thine, O Lord; thou doest wondrous things at all times.

Look, we beseech thee, and speedily have mercy upon thy people for thy name's sake in thine abundant mercies. O Lord our God, spare and be merciful; save the sheep of thy pasture; let not wrath rule over us, for our eyes are bent upon thee; save us for thy name's sake. Have mercy upon us for the sake of thy covenant; look, and answer us in time of trouble, for salvation is thine, O Lord. Our hope is in thee, O God of forgiveness. We beseech thee, forgive, O good and forgiving God, for thou art a gracious and merciful God and King.

We beseech thee, O gracious and merciful King, remember and give heed to the Covenant between the Pieces (with Abraham), and let the binding (upon the altar) of (Isaac) an only son appear before thee, to the welfare of Israel. Our Father, our King, be gracious unto us and answer us, for we are called by thy great name. Thou who doest wondrous things at all times, deal with us according to thy lovingkindness. O gracious and merciful Being, look, and answer us in time of trouble, for salvation is thine, O Lord. Our Father, our King, our Refuge, deal not with us according to the evil of our doings; remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; save us according to thy abundant goodness, and have pity upon us, we beseech thee, for we have no other God beside thee, our Rock.

{p. 74}

{cont}Forsake us not, O Lord bur God, be not far from us; for our soul is shrunken by reason of the sword and captivity and pestilence and plague, and of every trouble and sorrow. Deliver us, for we hope in thee; put us not to shame, O Lord our God; make thy countenance to shine upon us; remember unto us the covenant of our fathers, and save us for thy name's sake. Look upon our troubles, and hear the voice of our prayer, for thou hearest the prayer of every mouth.

Merciful and gracious God! Have mercy upon us and upon all thy works, for there is none like unto thee, O Lord our God. We beseech thee, forgive our transgressions, O our Father, our King, our Rock and our Redeemer, O living and everlasting God, mighty in strength, loving and good to all thy works; for thou art the Lord our God. O God, who art slow to anger and full of mercy, deal with us according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, and save us for thy name's sake. Hear our prayer, O our King, and deliver us from the hand of our enemies; hear our prayer, O our King, and deliver us from all trouble and sorrow. Thou art our Father, our King, and we are called by thy name; desert us not. Forsake us not, our Father, and cast us not off, O our Creator, and forget us not, O our Maker, for thou art a gracious and merciful God and King.

{p. 75}

There is none gracious and merciful like thee, O Lord our God; there is none like thee, O God, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and truth. Save us in thine abundant mercies; from fierceness and rage deliver us. Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; look not unto our stubbornness and our wickedness and our sin. Turn from thy fierce anger, and repent of the evil against thy people. Remove from us the stroke of death, for thou art merciful, for such is thy way—showing lovingkindness freely throughout all generations. Spare thy people, O Lord, and deliver us from thy wrath, and remove from us the stroke of the plague, and harsh decrees, for thou art the Guardian of Israel. Unto thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of face. How may we complain? What can we say, what can we speak, or how can we justify ourselves? We will search our ways and try them, and turn again to thee; for thy right hand is stretched out to receive the penitent. Save, we beseech thee, O Lord; we beseech thee, O Lord, send prosperity. We beseech thee, O Lord, answer us on the day when we call. For thee, O Lord, we wait; for thee, O Lord, we hope; in thee, O Lord, we trust; be not silent, nor let us be oppressed; for the nations say, Their hope is lost. Let every knee and all that is lofty bow down to thee alone.

O thou, who openest thy hand to repentance, to receive transgressors and sinners—our soul is sore vexed through the greatness of our grief; forget us not for

{p. 76}

ever; arise and save us, for we trust in thee. Our Father, our King, though we be without righteousness and good deeds, remember unto us the covenant of our fathers, and the testimony we bear every day that the Lord is One. Look upon our affliction, for many are our griefs and the sorrows of our heart. Have pity upon us, O Lord, in the land of our captivity, and pour not out thy wrath upon us, for we are thy people, the children of thy covenant. O God, look upon our sunken glory among the nations, and the abomination in which we are held as of utter defilement. How long shall thy strength remain in captivity, and thy glory in the hand of the foe? Arouse thy might and thy zeal against thine enemies, that they may be put to shame and broken down in their might. O let not our travail seem little in thy sight. Let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us in the day of our trouble; and if not for our sake, do it for thine own sake, and destroy not the remembrance of our remnant; but be gracious unto a people, who in constant love proclaim the unity of thy name twice every day, saying, Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

And David said unto Gad, I am troubled exceedingly; let us fall, I pray thee, into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are many; but let me not fall into the hand of man.

O thou who art merciful and gracious, I have sinned before thee. O Lord, full of mercy, have mercy upon me and receive my supplications.

{p. 77}

Psalm vi.

O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for I am withered away: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are troubled. My soul also is sore troubled: and thou, O Lord, how long? Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy lovingkindness’ sake. For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? I am weary with my groaning; every night I make my bed to swim; I melt away my couch with my tears. Mine eye wasteth away because of grief it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer. All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore troubled: they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.

On Monday and Thursday Mornings the following is added. On other Weekdays, and in the Afternoon Service, continue "O Guardian of Israel," {pr. 79}.

Reader and Cong.—O Lord God of Israel, turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of the evil against thy people.

Cong.—Look from heaven and see how we have become a scorn and a derision among the nations;

{p. 78}

we are accounted as sheep brought to the slaughter, to be slain and destroyed, or to be smitten and reproached.

Cong. and Reader.—Yet, despite all this, we have not forgotten thy name: we beseech thee, forget us not.

Cong.—Strangers say, There is no hope or expectancy for you. Be gracious unto a people that trust in thy name. O thou who art most pure, bring our salvation near. We are weary, and no rest is granted us. Let thy tender mercies subdue thine anger from us.

Cong. and Reader.—We beseech thee, turn from thy wrath, and have mercy upon the treasured people whom thou hast chosen.

Cong.—O Lord, spare us in thy tender mercies, and give us not into the hands of the cruel. Wherefore should the nations say, Where now is their God? For thine own sake deal kindly with us, and delay not.

Cong. and Reader.—We beseech thee, turn from thy wrath, and have mercy upon the treasured people whom thou hast chosen.

Cong.—Hear our voice, and be gracious, and forsake us not in the hand of our enemies to blot out our name; remember what thou hast sworn to our fathers, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven:—and now we are left a few out of many.

{p. 79}

Cong. and Reader.—Yet, despite all this, we have not forgotten thy name: we beseech thee, forget us not.

Cong.—Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and pardon our sins for thy name's sake.

Cong. and Reader.—O Lord God of Israel, turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of the evil against thy people.

O Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and suffer not Israel to perish, who say, Hear O Israel.

O Guardian of an only nation, guard the remnant of an only nation, and suffer not an only nation to perish, who proclaim the unity of thy name, saying, The Lord our God, the Lord is One.

O Guardian of a holy nation, guard the remnant of a holy nation, and suffer not a holy nation to perish, who thrice repeat the three-fold sanctification unto the Holy One.

O Thou who art propitiated by prayers for mercy, and art conciliated by supplications, be thou propitious and reconciled to an afflicted generation; for there is none that helpeth.

Our Father, our King, be gracious unto us, and answer us, for we have no good works of our own; deal with us in charity and lovingkindness, and save us.

{p. 80}

As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon thee. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. Let thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have waited for thee. Remember not against us the iniquities of our ancestors: let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low. Be gracious unto us, O Lord, be gracious unto us; for we are sated to the full with contempt. In wrath remember to be merciful. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and pardon our sins, for thy name's sake.

$Reader.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

Cong. and Reader.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

Reader.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen./$

O God, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and truth, rebuke us not in thine anger. Have pity upon thy people, O Lord, and save us from all evil. We have sinned against thee, O Lord: forgive, we beseech thee, according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, O God.

ORDER OF READING THE LAW.

The following to "as of old," {pr. 87}, forms part of the Service when Prayers are said with a Congregation on Mondays and Thursdays, and also, with the exception of "May it be the will," etc., to "Amen," {pr. 85}, on Sabbath Afternoons, New Moon, the Intermediate Days of Passover and Tabernacles, and on Fast Days (Mornings and Afternoons).

The Ark is Opened.

Reader and Cong.—And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise

{p. 82}

up, O Lord, and thine enemies shall be scattered, and they that hate thee shall flee before thee. For out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

Blessed be he who in his holiness gave the Law to his people Israel.

The Reader takes the Scroll of the Law, and says:—

Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.

$Reader and Cong.—Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine, O Lord, is the kingdom, and the supremacy as head over all. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool: holy is he. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mount; for the Lord our God is holy.

May the Father of mercy have mercy upon a people that have been borne by him. May he remember the covenant with the patriarchs, deliver our souls from evil hours, check the evil inclination in them that have been carried by him, grant us of his grace an everlasting deliverance, and in the attribute of his goodness fulfil our desires by salvation and mercy./$

{p. 83}

The Scroll of the Law is placed upon the desk. The Reader unrolls it, and says the following:—

And may his kingdom be soon revealed and made visible unto us, and may he be gracious unto our remnant and unto the remnant of his people, the house of Israel, granting them grace, kindness, mercy and favor; and let us say, Amen. Ascribe, all of you, greatness unto our God, and render honor to the Law.

Here the Reader names the Person who is to be called to the Reading of the Law.

Blessed be he, who in his holiness gave the Law unto his people Israel. The Law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The Lord will give strength unto his people: the Lord will bless his people with peace. As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a shield unto all them that trust in him.

Cong. and Reader.—And ye that cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day.

Those who are called to the Reading of the Law say the following Blessing:—

Bless ye the Lord who is to be blessed.

Cong.—Blessed be the Lord, who is to be blessed for ever and ever.

{p. 84}

The Response of the Congregation is repeated and the Blessing continued:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from all peoples, and hast given us thy Law. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who givest the Law.

After the Reading of a Section of the Law, the following Blessing is said:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast given us the Law of truth, and hast planted everlasting life in our midst. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who givest the Law.

Persons who have been in peril of their lives, during journeys by sea or land, in captivity or sickness, upon their deliverance or recovery say the following, after the conclusion of the last Blessing:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who vouchsafest benefits unto the undeserving, who hast also vouchsafed all good unto me.

The Congregation respond:—

He who hath vouchsafed all good unto thee, may he vouchsafe all good unto thee for ever.

After the Reading of the Law, the Scroll is held up, and the Congregation say the following:–

And this is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel, according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses. It is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one is rendered happy. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace.

{p. 85}

{cont}Length of days is in its right hand; in its left hand are riches and honor. It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Law and to make it honorable.

On those Mondays and Thursdays when the Prayers, pp. {prr. 70} to {prr. 81}, are said, the Reader adds the following, previous to the Scroll of the Law being returned to the Ark:—

$May it be the will of our Father who is in heaven to establish the Temple, the house of our life, and to restore his divine presence in our midst, speedily in our days; and let us say, Amen.

May it be the will of our Father who is in heaven to have mercy upon us and upon our remnant, and to keep destruction and the plague from us and from all his people, the house of Israel; and let us say, Amen.

May it be the will of our Father who is in heaven to preserve among us the wise men of Israel; them, their wives, their sons and daughters, their disciples and the disciples of their disciples in all the places of their habitation; and let us say, Amen.

May it be the will of our Father who is in heaven that good tidings of salvation and comfort may be heard and published, and that he may gather our banished ones from the four corners of the earth; and let us say, Amen.

As for our brethren, the whole house of Israel, such of them as are given over to trouble or captivity, whether they abide on the sea or on the dry land,—may the All-present have mercy upon them, and bring them forth from trouble to enlargement, from darkness to light, and from subjection to redemption, now speedily and at a near time; and let us say, Amen./$

{p. 86}

On returning the Scroll of the Law to the Ark, the Reader says:—

Let them praise the name of the Lord; for his name alone is exalted:

Congregation.—His majesty is above the earth and heaven; and he hath lifted up a horn for h, people, to the praise of all his loving ones, even of the children of Israel, the people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm xxiv.

A Psalm of David: The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. For it is he that hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? And who may stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not set his desire upon vanity, and hath not sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of them that seek after him, that seek thy face, (O God of) Jacob! (Selah.) Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty. the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. (Selah.)

While the Scroll of the Law is being placed in the Ark, the following to "as of old" is said:—

And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel. Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting place; thou, and the. ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy loving ones shout for joy. For the sake of David thy servant, turn not away the face of thine anointed. For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my Law. It is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one is rendered happy. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall return: renew our days as of old.

Happy are they that dwell in thy house: they will be ever praising thee. (Selah.)

Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy is the people, whose God is the Lord.

Psalm cxlv. A Psalm of Praise: of David

I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.

Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.

Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised: and his greatness is unsearchable.

One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.

On the majestic glory of thy grandeur, and on thy marvellous deeds, will I meditate.

And men shall speak of the might of thy awful acts; and I will recount thy greatness.

They shall pour forth the fame of thy great goodness, and shall exult in thy righteousness.

The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow to anger and of great lovingkindness.

The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.

All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and thy loving ones shall bless thee.

They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.

To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the majestic glory of his kingdom.

Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down.

The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in due season.

Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest every living thing with favor.

The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and loving. in all his works.

The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him. to all that call upon him in truth.

He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.

{p. 89}

The Lord guardeth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.

Psalm xx.

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The Lord answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; send thee help from the sanctuary, and uphold thee out of Zion; remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice (Selah); grant thee thy heart's desire, and fulfil all thy purpose. We will exult in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions. Now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the mighty saving acts of his right hand. Some trust in chariots and some in horses: but we will make mention of the name of the Lord our God. They are bowed down and fallen: but we are risen and stand upright. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call.

{p. 90}

And a redeemer shall come to Zion and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: my spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.

But thou art holy, O thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel.

Then a wind lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing (saying), Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place. {fr. *}Then a wind lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, of those who uttered praises, and said, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from the region of his divine abode.

For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and abounding in lovingkindness to all them that call upon thee. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy Law is truth. Thou wilt show truth to Jacob and lovingkindness to Abraham, according as thou has sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. Blessed be the Lord day b, day; if one burdeneth us, God is our salvation. (Selah.) The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah.) O Lord of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Messed is our God, who hath created us for his glory, and hath separated us from them that go astray, and hath given us the Law of truth and planted everlasting life in our midst. May he open our heart unto his Law, and place his love and fear within our hearts, that we may do his will and serve him with a perfect heart, that we may not labor in vain, nor bring forth for confusion. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that we may keep thy statutes in this world, and be worthy to live to witness and inherit happiness and blessing in the days of the Messiah and in the life of the world to come. To the end that my glory may sing praise unto thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose trust the Lord is. Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in Jah the Lord is an everlasting rock

For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else an truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law, the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.

Psalm xxiv.

A Psalm of David: The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. For it is he that hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.

{p. 96}

{cont}Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? And who may stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not set his desire upon vanity, and hath not sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of them that seek after him, that seek thy face, (O God of) Jacob! (Selah.)

(Psalm xlviii.)

A Song; a Psalm of the Sons of Korah. Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth is mount Zion,—at the sides of the north,—the city of the great king. God hath made himself known in her palaces as a stronghold. For, lo, the kings met each other, they passed on together. They saw it; then were they amazed; they were confounded, they hasted away. Trembling took hold of them there; pangs

{p. 97}

as of a woman in travail. With an east wind thou didst break the ships of Tarshish. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. (Selah.) We thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. As is thy name, O God, so is thy renown unto the ends of the earth; thy right hand is full of righteousness. Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. Compass ye Zion and go round about her: count the towers thereof. Mark ye well her rampart, traverse her palaces; that ye may tell a later generation, that this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.

A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the judges. How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? (Selah.) Judge the lowly and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and destitute. Rescue the lowly and needy: deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. They know not, neither do they understand; they walk about in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are moved. I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons

$This is the Fourth Day of the Week, on which the Levites in the Temple used to say:—/$

(Psalm xciv.)

O God of vengeance, Lord, O God of vengeance, shine forth. Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render to the proud their desert. Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? They prate, they speak arrogantly: all the workers of iniquity are boastful. They crush thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage. They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. And they say, The Lord will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed. Give heed, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see? He that chasteneth the nations, shall not he punish, even he that teacheth man knowledge? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vanity. Happy is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest out of thy Law; that thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil, until the pit be digged for the wicked. For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. For judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the. upright in heart shall follow it. Who will rise up for me against

{p. 99}

the evil-doers, who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had soon dwelt in silence. When I say, My foot slippeth, thy lovingkindness, O Lord, holdeth me up. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul. Hath the tribunal of destruction fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by statute? They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. But the Lord is become my stronghold; and my God the rock of my refuge. And he bringeth back upon them their own iniquity, and for their evil shall cut them off; the Lord our God shall cut them off.

O come, let us exult before the Lord: let us shout for joy to the rock of our salvation.

Raise the song, and strike the timbrel, the pleasant lyre with the harp. Blow the horn on the new moon, at the beginning of the month, for our day of festival. For it is a statute of Israel, a decree of the God of Jacob. He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went forth over the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I knew not. I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were freed from the basket. Thou calledst in

trouble and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder, I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. (Selah.) Hear, O my people, and I will testify against thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me. There shall be no strange god in thee; neither shalt thou worship any foreign god. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it. But my people hearkened not to my voice; and Israel was not willing towards me. So I let them go in the stubbornness of their heart, that they might walk in their own counsels. O that my people would hearken unto me, that Israel would walk in my ways. I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries. The haters of the Lord should submit themselves unto him; so that their time might endure for ever. He would feed them also with the fat of wheat: and with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.

They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be remembered no more. For they have consulted together with one consent; against thee do they make a covenant. The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagarenes; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre: Assyria also is joined with them; they have been an arm of help to the children of Lot. (Selah.) Do thou unto them as unto Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon. They were destroyed at Endor; they became as dung for the earth. Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna: who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of God. O my God, make them like the whirling dust, as stubble before the wind; as the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire: so pursue them with thy storm, and confound them with thy hurricane.

Psalm xxvii.

A Psalm of David. The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When evil-doers drew nigh against me to eat up my flesh, even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. Though an host should encamp against me, my heart would not fear; though war should rise against me, even then would I be confident. One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For in the day of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion: in the shelter of his tabernacle will be conceal me; he will lift me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joyful shouting; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord. Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice; have pity upon me, and answer me. My heart saith unto thee, (since thou hast said), Seek ye my face, Thy face, Lord will I seek. Hide not thy face from me; thrust not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. For nay father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me up. Teach me thy way, O Lord; and lead me on an even path, because of them that lie in wait for me Give me not up to the will of mine

{p. 103}

adversaries: for false witnesses have risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence. (I should despair), unless I believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord; be strong and let thine heart take courage; yea, wait thou for the Lord.

In some Congregations the following Psalm is said daily before "Blessed be he," etc., {pr. 19}.

Psalm xxx.

$A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; a Psalm of David. I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast drawn me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. O Lord, my God, I cried unto thee, and thou didst heal me. O Lord, thou broughtest up my soul from the grave; thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. Sing praise unto the Lord, O ye his loving ones, and give thanks to his holy name. For his anger is but for a moment; his favor is for a lifetime: weeping may tarry for the night, but joy cometh in the morning. As for me, I said in my prosperity I shall never be moved. Thou, Lord, of thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand strong; thou didst hide thy face; I was confounded. I cried unto thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication: What profit is there in my blood if I go down to the pit? Can the dust give thanks to thee? Can it declare thy truth? Hear, O Lord, and be gracious unto me; Lord, be thou my helper. Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness: to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever./$

2. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image; nor the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,

3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

4. Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is therein, and rested on the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.

7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken. diligently unto my commandments, which T command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. And I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; and the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon

{p. 133}

your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.

Numbers xv. 37–41.

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid theirs that they make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments, throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each corner a cord of blue: and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray: that ye may remember

{p. 134}

and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.

True and trustworthy is all this, and it is established with us that he is the Lord our God, and there is none beside him, and that We, Israel, are his people. It is he who redeemed us from the hand of kings, even our King, who delivered us from the grasp of all the terrible ones; the God, who on our behalf dealt out punishment to our adversaries, and requited all the enemies of our soul; who doeth great things past finding out, yea, and wonders without number; who holdeth our soul in life, and hath not suffered our feet to be moved; who made us tread upon the high places of our enemies, and exalted our horn over all them that hated us; who wrought for us miracles and vengeance upon Pharaoh, signs and wonders in the land of the children of Ham; who in his wrath smote all the first-born of Egypt, and brought forth his people Israel from among them to

{p. 135}

everlasting freedom; who made his children pass between the divisions of the Red Sea, hilt sank their pursuers and their enemies in the depths. Then his children beheld his might. they praised and gave thanks unto his name and willingly accepted his sovereignty. Moses and the children of Israel sang a song unto thee with great joy, saying, all of them,

Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the mighty ones? Who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, revered in praises, doing wonders?

$Thy children beheld thy sovereign power, as thou didst cleave the sea before Moses: they exclaimed, This is my God! and said, The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

And it is said, For the Lord hath delivered Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast redeemed Israel.

Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down in peace, and raise us up, O our King, unto life. Spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace; direct us aright through thine own good counsel; save us for thy name's sake; be thou a shield about us; remove from us every enemy, pestilence, sword, famine and sorrow; remove also the adversary from before us and from behind us. O shelter us beneath the shadow of thy wings;/$

$for thou, O God, art our Guardian and our Deliverer; yea, thou, O God, art a gracious and merciful King; and guard our going out and our coming in unto life and unto peace from this time forth and for evermore. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who guardest thy people Israel for ever./$

Let the glory of the Lord endure for ever; let the Lord rejoice in his works. Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore. For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake; because it hath pleased him to make you a people unto himself. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God. And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name

{cont}One. Let thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped for thee. Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and they shall glorify thy name: for thou art great and doest marvellous things; thou art God alone. But we are thy people and the sheep of thy pasture; we will give thanks unto thee for ever: we will recount thy praise to all generations.

Blessed be the Lord by day; blessed be the Lord by night; blessed be the Lord when we lie down; blessed be the Lord when we rise up. For in thy hand are the souls of the living and the dead, as it is said, In his hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. Into thy hand I commend my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. Our God who art in heaven, assert the unity of thy name, and establish thy kingdom continually, and reign over us for ever and ever.

May our eyes behold, our hearts rejoice, and our souls be glad in thy true salvation, when it

It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else: in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, then thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of le earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know

{p. 150}

that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law, The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.

Psalm xcv.

O come, let us exult before the Lord: let us shout for joy to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: let us shout for joy unto him with psalms. For the Lord is a great God, and a great king above all gods. In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. The sea is his, and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land. O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hearken to his voice! Harden not your hearts as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness: when your fathers tempted me, and proved me, although they had seen my work. Forty years long was I wearied with that generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways. Wherefore I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.

Psalm xcvi.

O sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, bless his name:

{p. 152}

proclaim his salvation from day to day. Recount his glory among the nations, his wondrous works among all the peoples. For great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised: he is to be revered above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought: but the Lord made the heavens. Splendor and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Give unto the Lord, ye families of the peoples, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: take an offering, and come into his courts. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth. Say among the nations, the Lord reigneth: the world also is set firm that it cannot be moved: he shall judge the peoples with equity. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; let the plain triumph and all that is therein; yea, let all the trees of the forest exult before the Lord, for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.

Psalm xcvii.

The Lord reigneth; let the earth be glad; let the many coast-lands rejoice. Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his adversaries round about. His lightnings illumine the world: the earth seeth and trembleth. The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of the whole earth. The

{p. 153}

heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples behold his glory. Ashamed are all they that serve graven images, that make their boast of things of nought: worship him, all ye gods. Zion heareth and rejoiceth, and the daughters of Judah are glad because of thy judgments, O Lord. For thou, Lord, art most high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. O ye that love the Lord, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his loving ones; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; and give thanks to his holy name.

Psalm xcviii.

A Psalm. O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him. The Lord hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he revealed in the sight of the nations. He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. Shout for joy unto the Lord, all the earth; break forth into exultation, and sing praises. Sing praises unto the Lord with the lyre; with the lyre and the sound of song. With trumpets and the sound of the horn shout for joy before the king. the Lord. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof, the world, and they that dwell therein. Let the streams clap their hands, let the mountains exult together before the Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.

Psalm xcix.

The Lord reigneth; let the peoples tremble: he sitteth above the cherubim; let the earth be moved. The Lord is great in Zion; and he is high above all the peoples. Let them give thanks to thy great and dreaded name; holy is he. And the strength of a king that loveth justice thou didst establish in equity; thou hast wrought justice and righteousness in Jacob. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool: holy is he. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name, called upon the Lord, and he answered them. He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: they kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them. Thou didst answer them, O Lord our God: a forgiving God thou wast unto them, though thou tookest vengeance on their misdeeds. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mount; for the Lord our God is holy.

Psalm xxix.

A Psalm of David. Give unto the Lord, O ye children of the mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth, even the Lord upon the great waters. The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty. The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. The voice of the Lord cleaveth flames of fire; the voice of the Lord maketh the

{p. 155}

wilderness to tremble; the Lord maketh tremble the wilderness of Kadesh. The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to travail, and strippeth the forests bare: and in his temple everything saith, Glory. The Lord sat as king at the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth as king for ever. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.

It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: to declare thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, with an instrument of ten strings and with a harp, with thoughtful music upon the lyre. For thou, O Lord, hast made me rejoice through thy work: I will exult in the works of thy hands. How great are thy works, O Lord: thy thoughts are very deep. A brutish man knoweth it not, neither doth a fool understand this: when the wicked sprang up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity flourished, it was that they might be destroyed for ever. But thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for,

lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. But my horn hast thou exalted, like that of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies; mine ears have heard my desire of them that rose up against me, doers of evil. The righteous shall spring up like a palm-tree; he shall grow tall like a cedar in Lebanon. Planted in the house of the Lord, they shall blossom in the courts of our God. They shall still shoot forth in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to declare that the Lord is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

Psalm xciii.

The Lord reigneth; he hath robed him in majesty; the Lord hath robed him, yea, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is set firm, that it cannot be moved. Thy throne is set firm from of old: thou art from everlasting. The streams have lifted up, O Lord, the streams have lifted up their voice; the streams lift up their roaring. Than the voices of many waters, mighty waters, breakers of the sea, more mighty is the Lord on high. Thy testimonies are very faithful: holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for evermore.

EVENING SERVICE FOR SABBATHS AND FESTIVALS

Reader.—Bless ye the Lord who is to be blessed.

Congregation in an undertone:

|$Blessed, praised, glorified, exalted and extolled be the name of the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who is the first and the last, and beside him there is no God. Extol ye him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, and rejoice before him. His name is exalted above all blessing and praise. Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever. Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore./$/|

Cong. and Reader.—Blessed is the Lord who is to be blessed for ever and ever.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who at thy word bringest on the evening twilight, with wisdom openest the gates of the heavens, and with understanding changest times and variest the seasons, and arrangest the stars in their watches in the sky, according to thy will. Thou createst day and night; thou rollest away the light from before the darkness, and the darkness from before the light; thou makest the day to pass and the night to approach, and dividest the day from the night, the Lord of hosts is thy name; a God living and enduring continually, mayest thou reign over us for ever and ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who bringest on the evening twilight.

With everlasting love thou hast loved the house of Israel, thy people; a Law and commandments, statutes and judgments hast thou taught us. Therefore. O Lord

{p. 160}

our God, when we lie down and when we rise up we will meditate on thy statutes: yea, we will rejoice in the words of thy Law and in thy commandments for ever; for they are our life and the length of our days and we will meditate on them day and night. And mayest thou never take away thy love from us. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who lovest thy people Israel.

When Prayers are not said with the Congregation, add:—

$God, faithful King!/$

Deut. vi. 4–9.

Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

$Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever./$

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shalt be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.

{p. 161}

Deut. xi. 13–21.

And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. And I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; and the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul: and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your

{p. 162}

hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.

Numbers xv. 37–41.

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each corner a cord of blue: and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray: that ye may remember and do

{p. 163}

all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the Land of Egypt, to be your God; I am the Lord your God.

True and trustworthy is all this, and it is established with us that he is the Lord our God, and there is none beside him, and that we, Israel, are his people. It is he who redeemed us from the hand of kings, even our King, who delivered us from the grasp of all the terrible ones; the God, who on our behalf dealt out punishment to our adversaries, and requited all the enemies of our soul; who doeth great things past finding out, yea, and wonders without number; who holdeth our soul in life, and hath not suffered our feet to be moved; who made us tread upon the high places of our enemies, and exalted our horn over all them that hated us; who wrought for us miracles and vengeance upon Pharaoh, signs and wonders in the land of the children of Ham; who in his wrath smote all the first-born of Egypt, and brought forth his

{p. 164}

people Israel from among them to everlasting freedom; who made his children pass between the divisions of the Red Sea, but sank their pursuers and their enemies in the depths. Then his children beheld his might; they praised and gave thanks unto his name, and willingly accepted his sovereignty. Moses and the children of Israel sang a song unto thee with great joy, saying, all of them,

Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the mighty ones? Who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, revered in praises, doing wonders?

$Thy children beheld thy sovereign power, as thou didst cleave the sea before Moses: they exclaimed, This is my God! and said,

The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

And it is said, For the Lord hath delivered Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast redeemed Israel.

Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down in peace, and raise us up, O our King, unto life. Spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace; direct us aright through thine own good counsel; save us for thy name's sake; be thou a shield about us; remove from is every enemy, pestilence, sword, famine and sorrow;/$

{p. 165}

$remove also the adversary from before us and from behind us. O shelter us beneath the shadow of thy wings; for thou, O God, art our Guardian and our Deliverer; yea, thou, O God, art a gracious and merciful King; and guard our going out and our coming in unto life and unto peace from this time forth and for evermore; yea, spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who spreadest the tabernacle of peace over us and over all thy people Israel, and over Jerusalem./$

On Sabbaths:—

Exodus xxxi. 16, 17.

$And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever, that in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and ceased from his work./$

On Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles, say:—

$And Moses declared the set feasts of the Lord unto the children of Israel./$

$O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise./$

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses, and possessest all things;: who rememberest the pious deeds of the patriarchs, and in love wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.

On the Sabbath of Penitence say:—

$Remember us unto life, O King, who delightest in. life, and inscribe us in the book of life, for thine own Bake, O living God./$

{p. 167}

O King, Helper, Saviour and Shield. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the Shield of Abraham.

Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art mighty to save.

From the Sabbath after the Eighth Day of Solemn Assembly until the First Day of Passover say:—

$Thou causest the wind to blow and the rain to fall./$

Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth?

On the Sabbath of Penitence say:—

$Who is like unto thee, Father of mercy, who in mercy rememberest thy creatures unto life?/$

Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead.

{p. 168}

Thou art holy, and thy name is holy, and holy beings praise thee daily. (Selah.) Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.

On the Sabbath of Penitence conclude the Blessing thus:—

$the holy King./$

Thou didst hallow the seventh day unto thy name, as the end of the creation of heaven and earth; thou didst bless it above all days, and didst hallow it above all seasons; and thus it is written in thy Law:

And the heaven and the earth were finished and all their host. And on the seventh day God had finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and he hallowed it because he rested thereon from all his work which God had created and made.

Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest; sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant our portion in thy Law;

{p. 169}

satisfy us with thy goodness, and gladden us with thy salvation; purify our hearts to serve thee in truth; and in thy love and favor, O Lord our God, let us inherit thy holy Sabbath; and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rest thereon. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

On New Moon and the Intermediate Days of Passover and Tabernacles the following is added:—

$Our God and God of our fathers! May our remembrance rise, come and be accepted before thee, with the remembrance of our fathers, of Messiah the son of David thy servant, of Jerusalem thy holy city, and of all thy people the house of Israel, bringing deliverance and well-being, grace, lovingkindness and mercy, life and peace on this day of/$

We will give thanks unto thee and declare thy praise for our lives which are committed unto thy hand, and for our souls which are in thy charge, and for thy miracles, which are daily with us, and for thy wonders and thy benefits which are wrought at all times, evening, morn and noon.

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law,

{p. 172}

and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.

$May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law.

Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years./$

And the heaven and the earth were finished and all their host.

The following to "the Sabbath," is omitted when Prayers are not said with the Congregation:—

Reader.—Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, Possessor of heaven and earth.

Reader and Cong.—He with his word was a shield to our forefathers, and by his bidding will quicken the dead; the holy God (on the Sabbath of Penitence say, "holy King"), like unto whom there is none; who giveth rest to his people on his holy Sabbath day, because he took pleasure in them to grant them rest. Him we will serve with fear and awe, and daily and constantly we will give thanks unto his name in the fitting forms of Blessings. He is the God to who, thanksgivings are due, the Lord of peace, who halloweth the Sabbath and blesseth the seventh day, and in holiness giveth rest unto a people sated with delights, in remembrance of the creation.

Reader.—Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest; sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness, gladden us with thy salvation; purify our hearts to serve thee in truth; and in thy love and favor, O Lord our God, let us inherit thy holy Sabbath; and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rest thereon.

The following is not said on Festivals, on the Intermediate Sabbath of a Festival, or on the evening after a Festival:—

Mishnah, Treatise Sabbath, ch. ii.

1. With what materials may the Sabbath lamp be lighted, and with what may it not be lighted? It may not be lighted with cedar-bast, nor with uncombed flax, nor with floss-silk, nor with willow-fibre, nor with nettle fibre, nor with waterweeds

{p. 175}

{cont}(all these forming imperfect wicks). It may also not be lighted with pitch, nor with liquid wax, nor with oil made from the seeds of the cotton plant, nor with oil which, having been set apart as a heave-offering and having become defiled, is condemned to be destroyed by burning, nor with the fat from the tails of sheep, nor with tallow. Nahum the Mede, says one may use tallow when it has been boiled, but the other sages say, that whether so prepared or not, it may not be used. 2. On a festival one may not use such consecrated oil as has been condemned, after defilement, to be burnt. R. Ishmael says, one may not, from respect to the Sabbath, use tar. The sages permit the use of all kinds of oil; the oil of sesamum, of nuts, of radish seeds, of fish, of colocynth seeds, as well as tar and naphtha. R. Tarphon says, one may use no other than olive oil for lighting the Sabbath lamp. 3. No part of a tree may be used as a wick for lighting, with the exception of flax (spoken of in Joshua ii. 6 as "the flax of a tree"); nor is any part of a tree, if used in the construction of a tent, capable of acquiring pollution according to the law concerning the pollution of tents, except flax. If a slip of cloth has been folded but not singed, R. Eliezer says it may become unclean, and may not be used as a wick for lighting; R. Akiba says it remains clean, and may be used. 4. One may not perforate an egg-shell, fill it with oil, and place it above the opening of the lamp, so that drops of oil may fall therein; he may not even employ an earthenware vessel in this manner; but R. Jehudah permits it. If, however, the potter had originally joined the two parts, then it is allowed, because it is actually only one vessel. A person may not fill a bowl with oil, place it by the side of the lamp, and put the end of the wick into it, so that it may draw the oil to the flame; but R. Jehudah permits it. 5. He who extinguishes the light, because he is in fear of heathens, or robbers, or of en evil spirit. or to enable a sick person to sleep, is absolved;

{p. 176}

if his object is to save the lamp, the oil, or the wick, he is guilty of a breach of the Sabbath law. R. Jose absolves from such guilt in every case except in that of the one whose object is to save the wick, because by thus extinguishing it, he converts it into a coal. 6. For three transgressions women die in childbirth: because they have been negligent in regard to their periods of separation, in respect to the consecration of the first cake of the dough, and in the lighting of the Sabbath lamp. 7. Three things a man must say to his household on Sabbath eve towards dusk: Have ye separated the tithe? Have ye made the Erub? Kindle the Sabbath lamp. If it be doubtful whether it is dark, that which is certainly untithed must not then be tithed, vessels must not be immersed to purify them from their defilement, nor must the Sabbath lamps be lighted; but that which is doubtfully untithed may be tithed, the Erub may be made, and hot victuals may be covered to retain their heat.

Talmud Babli. End of Treatise Berachoth.

R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Chanina, The disciples of the sages increase peace throughout the world, as it is said, And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children. (Read not here banayich, by children, but bonayich, thy builders.)—Great peace have they who love thy Law; and there is no stumbling for them. Peace be within thy rampart, prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes I would fain speak peace concerning thee. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God I would seek thy good. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.

Kiddush is said by the Reader, {pr. 181}.

It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us

{p. 177}

like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else; in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law,

{p. 178}

{cont}The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that lay shall the Lord be One, and his name One.

The following Kaddish is said by a Mourner.

Mourner.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your if e and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

Cong. and Mourner.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

Mourner.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

Cong.—Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore.

Mourner.—May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

Cong.—My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

Mourner.—He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

1. Magnified and praised be the living God: he is, and there is no limit in time unto his being.

2. He is One, and there is no unity like unto his unity; inconceivable is he, and unending is his unity.

{p. 179}

3. He hath neither bodily form nor substance: we can compare nought unto him in his holiness.

4. He was before anything that hath been created—even the first: but his existence had no beginning.

5. Behold he is the Lord of the universe: to every creature he teacheth his greatness and his sovereignty.

6. The rich gift of his prophecy he gave unto the men of his choice, in whom he gloried.

7. There hath never yet arisen in Israel a prophet like unto Moses, one who hath beheld his similitude.

8. The Law of truth God gave unto his people by the hand of his prophet, who was faithful in his house.

9. God will not alter nor change his Law to ever, lasting for any other.

10. He watcheth and knoweth our secret thoughts: he beholdeth the end of a thing before it existeth.

11. He bestoweth lovingkindness upon a man according to his work; he giveth to the wicked evil according to his wickedness.

12. He will send our anointed at the end of days, to redeem them that wait for the end—his salvation.

13. In the abundance of his lovingkindness God will quicken the dead. Blessed for evermore be his glorious name.

On the Eve of Sabbaths and of Holydays it is customary for Parents, either at the conclusion of the Service in Synagogue, or upon reaching their Home, to pronounce the following Benediction upon their Children:—

To Sons say:—

God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh.

To Daughters say:—

God make thee as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.

To Sons and Daughters:—

The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.

The following is said in the Home by the Master of the House:—

Proverbs xxxi. 10–31.

A woman of worth who can find? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband trusteth in her; and he shall have no lack of gain. She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life. She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. She is like the merchant-ships; she bringeth her food from afar. She riseth also while it is yet night, and setteth forth provision for her household, and their portion for her maidens. She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms. She perceiveth that her earnings are good: her lamp goeth not out by night. She putteth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she putteth forth her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet. She maketh for herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is fine linen and purple. Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. She maketh linen garments and selleth them; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. Strength and majesty are her clothing; and she laugheth at the time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and the law of lovingkindness is on her tongue. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and call her happy; her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying, Many daughters have done worthily, but thou excellest them all. Favor is false, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her works praise her in the gates.

KIDDUSH FOR SABBATH EVENING.

The following is said in the Home by the Master of the House, previous to partaking of the Sabbath Meal:—

$And it was evening and it was morning—the sixth day./$

And the heaven and the earth were finished and all their host. And on the seventh day God had finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and he hallowed it, because he rested thereon from all his work which God had created and made.

$Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the fruit of the vine./$

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments and hast taken pleasure in us, and in love and favor hast given us thy holy Sabbath as an inheritance, a memorial of the creation—that day being also the first of the holy convocations, in remembrance of the departure from Egypt. For thou hast chosen us and sanctified us above all nations, and in love and favor hast given us thy holy Sabbath as an inheritance. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath.

$Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who bringest forth bread from the earth./$

MORNING SERVICE FOR SABBATHS AND FESTIVALS.

Begin page {prr. 2} to "the Lord is One," {pr. 43}. Then continue as follows:—

The breath of every living being shall bless thy name, O Lord our God, and the spirit of all flesh shall continually glorify and exalt thy memorial, O our King; from everlasting to everlasting thou art God; and beside thee we have no King who redeemeth and saveth, setteth free and delivereth, who supporteth and hath mercy in all times of trouble and distress; yea, we have no King but thee.

He is God of the first and of the last, the God of all creatures, the Lord of all generations, who is extolled with many praises, and guideth his world with lovingkindness and his creatures with tender mercies. The Lord slumbereth not, nor sleepeth; he arouseth the sleepers and awakeneth the slumberers; he maketh the dumb to speak, loseth the bound, supporteth .the falling, and raiseth up the bowed.

To thee alone we give thanks. Though our mouths were full of song as the sea, and our tongues of exultation as the multitude of its waves, and our lips of praise as the wide-extended firmament; though our eyes shone with light like the sun and the moon, and our hands were spread forth like the eagles of heaven, and our feet were swift as hinds, we should still be unable to thank thee and to bless thy name, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, for one thousandth or one ten thousandth

{p. 183}

part of the bounties which thou hast bestowed upon our fathers and upon us. Thou didst redeem us from Egypt, O Lord our God, and didst release us from the house of bondage; during famine thou didst feed us, and didst sustain us in plenty; from the sword thou didst rescue us, from pestilence thou didst save us, and from sore and lasting diseases thou didst deliver us. Hitherto thy tender mercies have helped us, and thy lovingkindnesses have not left us: forsake us not, O Lord our God, for ever. Therefore the limbs which thou hast spread forth upon us, and the spirit and breath which thou hast breathed into our nostrils, and the tongue which thou hast set in our mouths, lo, they shall thank, bless, praise, glorify, extol, reverence, hallow and assign kingship to thy name, O Our King. For every mouth shall give thanks unto thee, and every tongue shall swear unto thee; every knee shall bow to thee, and whatsoever is lofty shall prostrate itself before thee; all hearts shall fear thee, and all the inward parts and reins shall sing unto thy name, according to the word that is written, All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee? Thou deliverest the poor from him that is stronger than he, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him. Who is like unto thee, who is equal to thee, who can be compared unto thee, O God, great, mighty, and awful, most high God, Possessor of heaven and earth? We will praise,

{p. 184}

laud and glorify thee, and we will bless thy holy name, as it is said, (A Psalm of David,) Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Thou art God in thy power and might, great in thy glorious name, mighty for ever and awful by thy awful acts, the King who sitteth upon a high and lofty throne.

He who inhabiteth eternity, exalted and holy is his name; and it is written, Exult in the Lord, O ye righteous; praise is seemly for the upright.

By the mouth of the upright thou shalt be praised, by the words of the righteous thou shalt be blessed, by the tongue of the loving ones thou shalt be extolled, and in the midst of the holy thou shalt be hallowed.

In the assemblies also of the tens of thousands of thy people, the house of Israel, thy name, O our King, shall be glorified with joyous dies in every generation; for such is the duty of all creatures in thy presence, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to thank, praise, laud, glorify, extol, honor, bless, exalt and adore thee, even beyond all the words of song and praise of David the son of Jesse, thy servant and anointed.

{p. 185}

Praised be thy name for ever, O our King, the great and holy God and King, in heaven and on earth; for unto thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, song and praise are becoming, hymn and psalm, strength and dominion, victory, greatness and might, renown and glory, holiness and sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings from henceforth even for ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, God and King, great in praises, God of thanksgivings, Lord of wonders, who makest choice of song and psalm, O King and God, the life of all worlds.

In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy possessions. O King, who alone wast exalted {fp. 187} from aforetime, praised, glorified and extolled from days of old; O everlasting God, in thine abundant mercies, have mercy upon us, Lord of our strength Rock of our stronghold, Shield of our salvation, thou Stronghold of ours! The blessed God, great in knowledge, prepared and formed the rays of the sun: it was a boon he produced as a glory to his name: he set the luminaries round about his strength. The chiefs of his hosts are holy beings that exalt the Almighty, and continually {fp. 189} declare the glory of God and his holiness. Be thou blessed, O Lord our God, for the excellency of thy handiwork, and for the bright luminaries which thou hast made: they shall glorify thee for ever.

In mercy thou givest light to the earth and to there that dwell thereon, and in thy goodness renewest the creation every day continually; O King, who alone wast exalted from aforetime, praised, glorified and extolled from days of old. O everlasting God, in thine abundant mercies, have mercy upon us, Lord of our strength, Rock of our stronghold, Shield of our salvation, thou Stronghold of ours! There is none to be compared unto thee, neither is there any beside thee; there is none but thee: who is like unto thee? There is none to be compared unto thee, O Lord our God, in this world, neither is there any beside thee, O our King, for the life of the world to come; there is none but thee, O our Redeemer, for the days of the Messiah; neither is there any like unto thee. O our Saviour, for the resurrection of the dead.

God, the Lord over all works, blessed is he, and ever to be blessed by the mouth of everything that hath breath. His greatness and goodness fill the universe; knowledge and understanding surround him: he is exalted above the holy Chayoth and is adorned in glory above the celestial chariot{fr. *}: purity and rectitude are before his throne,

The luminaries are good which our God hath created: he formed them with knowledge, understanding and discernment; he gave them might and power to rule in the midst of the world. They are full of lustre, and they radiate brightness: beautiful is their lustre throughout all the world. They rejoice in their going forth, and are glad in their returning; they perform with awe the will of their Master. Glory and honor they render unto his name, exultation and rejoicing at the remembrance of his sovereignty. He called unto the sun, and it shone forth in light: he looked, and ordained the figure of the moon. All the hosts on high render praise unto him, the Seraphim, the Ophanim and the holy Chayoth ascribing glory and greatness

To the God who rested from all his works, and on the seventh day exalted himself and sat upon the throne of his glory; who robed himself in glory on the day of rest, and called the Sabbath day a delight. This is the praise of the Sabbath day, that God rested thereon from all his work, when the Sabbath day itself offered praise and said, "A Psalm, a song of the Sabbath day, It is good to give thanks into the Lord."{fr. *} Therefore let all his creatures glorify and bless God; let them render praise, honor

Be thou blessed, O our Savior, for the excellency of thy handiwork, and for the bright luminaries which thou hast made: they shall glorify thee for ever.

Be thou blessed, O our Rock, our King and Redeemer, Creator of holy beings, praised be thy name for ever, O our King; Creator of ministering spirits, all of whom stand in the heights of the universe, and proclaim with awe in unison aloud the words of the living God and everlasting King.

The name of the Divine King, the great, mighty and dreaded One, holy is he; and they all take upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven one from the other, and give sanction to one another to hallow their Creator: in tranquil joy of spirit, with pure speech and holy melody they all respond in unison, and exclaim with awe:

~Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory./~

And the Ophanim and the holy Chayoth with a noise of great rushing, upraising themselves towards the Seraphim, thus over against them offer praise and say:

~Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place./~

To the blessed God they offer pleasant melodies; to the King, the living and ever-enduring God, they utter hymns and make their praises heard; for he alone performeth mighty deeds, and maketh new things; he is the Lord of battles; he soweth righteousness, causeth salvation to spring forth, createth remedies, and is revered in praises. He is the Lord of wonders, who in his goodness reneweth the creation every day continually; as it is said, (O give thanks) to him that maketh great lights, for his lovingkindness

With abounding love hast thou loved us, O Lord our God, with great and exceeding pity hast thou pitied us. O our Father, our King, for our fathers’ sake, who trusted in thee, and whom thou didst teach the statutes of life, be also gracious unto us and teach us. O our Father, merciful Father, ever-compassionate, have mercy upon us: O put it into our hearts to understand and to discern, to mark, learn and teach, to heed, to do and to fulfil in love all the words of instruction in thy Law. Enlighten our eyes in thy Law, and let our hearts cleave to thy commandments, and unite our hearts to love and fear thy name, so that we be never put to shame. Because we have trusted in thy holy, great and revered name, we shall rejoice and be glad in thy salvation. O bring us in peace from the four corners of the earth, and make us go upright to our land; for thou art a God who worketh salvation. Thou hast chosen us from all peoples and tongues, and hast brought us near unto thy great name for ever in faithfulness, that we might in love give thanks unto thee and proclaim thy unity. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast chosen thy people Israel in love.

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign -upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.

And I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; and the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and the land yield not her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: that your

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel,. and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each corner a cord of blue: and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray: that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.

True and firm, established and enduring, right and faithful, beloved and precious, desirable and pleasant, revered and mighty, well-ordered and acceptable, good and beautiful is this thy word unto us for ever and ever. It is true, the God of the universe is our King, the Rock of Jacob, the Shield of our salvation: throughout all generations he endureth and his name endureth; his throne is established, and his kingdom and his faithfulness endure for ever. His words also live and endure; they are faithful and desirable for ever and to all eternity, as for our fathers so also for us, our children, our generations, and for all the generations of the seed of Israel his servants.

For the first and for the last ages thy word is good and endureth for ever and ever; it is true and trust, worthy, a statute which shall not pass away. True it is that thou art indeed the Lord our God and the God of our fathers, our King, our fathers’ King, our Redeemer, the Redeemer of our fathers, our Maker, the Rock of our salvation; our Deliverer and Rescuer from everlasting, such is thy name; there is no God beside thee.

Thou hast been the help of our fathers from of old, a Shield and Savior to their children after them in every generation: in the heights of the universe is thy habitation, and thy judgments and thy righteousness reach to the furthest ends of the earth. Happy is the man who hearkeneth unto thy commandments, and layeth up thy Law and thy word in his heart.

{cont}True it is that thou art indeed the Lord of thy people, and a mighty King to plead their cause. True it is that thou art indeed the first and thou art the last beside thee we have no King, Redeemer and Savior. From Egypt thou didst redeem us, O Lord our God, and from the house of bondmen thou didst deliver us; all their first-born thou didst slay, but thy first-born thou didst redeem; thou didst divide the Red Sea, and drown the proud; but thou madest the beloved to pass through, while the waters covered their adversaries, not one of whom was left. Wherefore the beloved praised and extolled God, and offered hymns, songs, praises, blessings and thanksgivings to the King and God, who liveth and endureth; who is high and exalted, great and revered; who bringeth low the haughty, and raiseth up the lowly, leadeth forth the prisoners, delivereth the meek, helpeth the poor, and answereth his people when they cry unto him; even praises to the Most High God, blessed is he, and ever to be blessed. Moses and the children of Israel sang a song unto thee with great joy, saying. all of them,

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses, and possessest all things; who rememberest the pious deeds of the patriarchs, and in love wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.

Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth?

On the Sabbath of Penitence say:—

$Who is like unto thee, Father of mercy, who in mercy rememberest thy creatures unto life?/$

Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead. * (See page {prr. 199}).

Reader.—Then with a noise of great rushing, mighty and strong, they make their voices heard, and, upraising themselves toward the Seraphim, they exclaim over against them, Blessed—

Cong.—Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.

Reader.—From thy place shine forth, O our King, and reign over us, for we wait for thee. When wilt thou reign in Zion? Speedily, even in our days, do thou dwell there, and for ever. Mayest thou be magnified and sanctified in the midst of Jerusalem thy city throughout all generations and to all eternity. O let our eyes behold thy kingdom, according to the word that was spoken in the songs of thy might by David, thy righteous anointed:

Cong.—The Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

{p. 200}

Reader.—Unto all generations we will declare thy greatness, and to all eternity we will proclaim thy holiness, and thy praise, O our God, shall not depart from our mouth for ever, for thou art a great and holy God and King. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.

On the Sabbath of Penitence conclude the Blessing thus:—

$the holy King./$

Moses rejoiced in the gift of his portion, for thou didst call him a faithful servant: a diadem of glory didst thou place upon his head, when he stood before thee upon Mount Sinai; and in his hand he brought down the two tables of stone, upon which the observance of the Sabbath was prescribed, and. thus it is written in thy Law:

Exodus xxxi. 16, 17.

And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever, that in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and ceased from his work.

{p. 201}

And thou didst not give it, O Lord our God, unto the nations of other lands, nor didst thou, O our King, make it the heritage of worshipers of idols, nor do the uncircumcised dwell in its rest; but unto thy people Israel thou didst give it in love, unto the seed of Jacob whom thou didst choose. The people that hallow the seventh day, even all of them shall be satiated and delighted with thy goodness, seeing that thou didst find pleasure in the seventh day, and didst hallow it; thou didst call it the desirable of days, in remembrance of the creation.

Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest; sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness, and gladden us with thy salvation; purify our hearts to serve thee in truth; and in thy love and favor, O Lord our God, let us inherit thy holy Sabbath; and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rest thereon. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath,

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

On the Sabbath of Penitence say:—

$O inscribe all the children of thy covenant for a happy life./$

At the repetition of the Amidah by the Reader the following is introduced:—

$Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the three-fold blessing of thy Law written by the hand of Moses thy servant, which was spoken by Aaron and his sons, the priests, thy holy people, as it is said, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace./$

Grant peace, welfare, blessing, grace, lovingkindness and mercy unto us and unto all Israel, thy people. Bless us, O our Father, even all of us together, with the light of thy countenance; for by the light of thy countenance thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the Law

of life, lovingkindness and righteousness, blessing, mercy, life and peace; and may it be good in thy sight to bless thy people Israel at all times and in every hour with thy peace.

On the Sabbath of Penitence say:—

$In the book of life, blessing, peace and good sustenance may we be remembered and inscribed before thee, we and all thy people the house of Israel, for a happy life and for peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest peace./$

Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace.

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth

{p. 206}

and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who

maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

On New Moon, Festivals, the Intermediate Days of Festivals and on Chanukah, Hallel, {pr. 313}, is said after the Amidah

Reader.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

Cong. and Reader.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

Reader.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

Cong.—Accept our prayer in mercy and in favor.

ORDER OF READING THE LAW ON SABBATHS AND FESTIVALS.

There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; and there are no works like unto thine. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. The Lord reigneth; the Lord hath reigned; the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.

Father of mercies, do good in thy favor unto Zion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem. For in thee alone do we trust, O King, high and exalted God, Lord of worlds.

The Ark is Opened.

Reader and Cong.—And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Lord, and thine enemies shall be scattered, and they that hate thee shall flee before thee. For out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

{p. 208}

The Reader takes the Scroll of the Law and Says:—

Blessed be he who in his holiness gave the Law to his people Israel.

In some Congregations the following is said:—

$Zohar, Parshath Vayakhel./$

Blessed be the name of the Sovereign of the universe. Blessed be thy crown and thy abiding-place. Let thy favor rest with thy people Israel for ever: show them the redemption of thy right hand in thy holy temple. Vouchsafe unto us the benign gift of thy light, and in mercy accept our supplications. May it be thy will to prolong our life in well-being. Let me also be numbered among the righteous, so that thou mayest be merciful unto me, and have me in thy keeping, with all that belong to me and to thy people Israel. Thou art he that feedeth and sustaineth all; thou art he that ruleth over all; thou art he that ruleth over kings, for dominion is thine. I am the servant of the Holy One, blessed be he, before whom and before whose glorious Law I prostrate myself at all times: not in man do I put my trust, nor upon any angel do I rely, but upon the God of heaven, who is the God of truth, and whose Law is truth, and whose prophets are prophets of truth, and who aboundeth in deeds of goodness and truth. In him I put my trust, and unto his holy and glorious name I utter praises. May it be thy will to open my heart unto thy Law, and to fulfil the wishes of my heart and of the hearts of all thy people Israel for good, for life, and for peace.

{p. 209}

On Festivals the following is said:—

The Lord, the Lord is a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and truth; keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin. (To be said three times.)

Lord of the universe, fulfil the wishes of my heart for good; grant my desire, give me my request, even unto me, thy servant, — the son of — (thy maid servant — the daughter of —), and make me worthy (together with my wife,) (my husband,) (my children,) to do thy will with a perfect heart; and deliver me from the evil inclination. O grant our portion in thy Law; make us worthy to have thy divine presence abiding with us; vouchsafe unto us the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and fear of the Lord. So also may it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that I may be fitted to do such deeds as are good in thy sight, and to walk in the way of the upright before thee. Sanctify us by thy commandments, that we may merit the long and blessed life of the world to come: guard us from evil deeds, and also from evil hours that visit and afflict this world. As for him who trusteth in the Lord, let lovingkindness surround him Amen.

Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

And as for me, may my prayer unto thee, O Lord, be in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, answer me in the truth of thy salvation.

(This verse is said three times.)

{p. 210}

The Reader takes the Scroll of the Law, and the following is said:—

Reader and Cong.—Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

Reader and Cong.—One is our God; great is our Lord; holy is his name.

Reader.—Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.

Reader and Cong.—Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine, O Lord, is the kingdom, and the supremacy as head over all. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool: holy is he. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mount; for the Lord our God is holy.

Magnified and hallowed, praised and glorified, exalted and extolled above all be the name of the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, in the worlds which he hath created,—this world and the world to come,—in accordance with his desire, and with the desire of them that fear him, and of all the house of Israel: the Rock everlasting, the Lord of all creatures, the God of all souls, who dwelleth in the wide-extended heights, who inhabiteth the heaven of heavens of old; whose holiness is above the Chayoth and above the throne of glory. Now, therefore, thy name, O Lord our God, shall be hallowed amongst us

{p. 211}

in the sight of all living. Let us sing a new song be, fore him, as it is written, Sing unto God, sing praises unto his name, extol ye him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, and exult before him. And may we see him, eye to eye, when he returneth to his habitation, as it is written, For they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord returneth unto Zion. And it is said, And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

May the Father of mercy have mercy upon a people that have been borne by him. May he remember the covenant with the patriarchs, deliver our souls from evil hours, check the evil inclination in them that have been carried by him, grant us of his grace an everlasting deliverance, and in the attribute of his goodness fulfil our desires by salvation and mercy.

The Scroll of the Law is placed upon the desk, and the Reader says the following:—

And may he help, shield and save all who trust in him, and let us say, Amen. Ascribe all of you greatness unto our God, and render honor to the Law.

Here the Reader names the Person who is called to the Reading of the Law.

Blessed be he, who in his holiness gave the Law unto his people Israel. The Law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The Lord will give strength unto his people,

{p. 212}

the Lord will bless his people with peace. As for God his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a shield unto all them that trust in him.

Cong. and Reader.—And ye that cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day.

Those who are called to the Reading of the Law say the following Blessing:—

Bless ye the Lord who is to be blessed.

Cong.—Blessed be the Lord, who is to be blessed for ever and ever.

"Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who vouchsafest benefits unto the undeserving, who hast also vouchsafed all good unto me.

The Congregation respond:—

He who hath vouchsafed all good unto thee, may he vouchsafe all good unto thee for ever.

The following is said by the Father of a Bar-Mitzvah, when the latter has concluded the Blessing after having been called to the Reading of the Law.

Blessed be he who hath freed me from the responsibility for this child.

After the Reading of the Law, the Scroll is held up, and the Congregation say the following:—

And this is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel, according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses. It is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one is rendered happy. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Length of days is in its right hand; in its left hand are riches and honor. It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Law and to make it honorable.

Before the Lesson from the Prophets the following is said:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen good prophets, and hast found pleasure in their words which were spoken

Faithful art thou, O Lord our God, and faithful are thy words, and not one of thy words shall return void, for thou art a faithful and merciful God and King. Blessed art thou, O Lord, God, who art faithful in all thy words.

Have mercy upon Zion, for it is the home of our life, and save her that is grieved in spirit speedily, even iii our days. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest Zion joyful through her children.

Gladden us, O Lord our God, with Elijah the prophet, thy servant, and with the kingdom of the house of David, thine anointed. Soon may he come and rejoice our hearts. Suffer not a stranger to sit upon his throne, nor let others any longer inherit his glory; for by thy holy name thou didst swear unto him, that his right should not be quenched for ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the Shield of David.

{p. 215}

On Sabbaths, including the Intermediate Sabbath of Passover, say:—

For the Law, for the divine service, for the prophets, and for this Sabbath day, which thou, O Lord our God, hast given us for holiness and for rest, for honor and for glory.

{p. 219}

The Reader takes the Scroll of the Law, and says the following Prayer for the Government.

He who giveth salvation unto kings and dominion unto princes, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, who delivered his servant David from the hurtful sword, who maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters.—may he bless, guard, protect, and help, exalt, magnify, and highly aggrandize

THE CONSTITUTED OFFICERS OF THIS GOVERNMENT.

May the Supreme King of Kings in his mercy preserve them in life and deliver them from all trouble and hurt. May the Supreme King of Kings in his mercy exalt them and raise them on high, and grant them a long and prosperous rule. May the Supreme King of Kings in his mercy inspire them and all their counsellors and officers with benevolence toward us, and all Israel our brethren. In their days and in ours may Judah be saved and Israel dwell securely; and may the redeemer come unto Zion. O that this may be his will, and let us say, Amen.

On the Sabbath preceding New Moon the following is said:—

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to renew unto us this coming month for good and for Blessing.

{p. 220}

O grant us long life, a life of peace, of good, of blessing, of sustenance, of bodily vigor, a life marked by the fear of Heaven and the dread of sin, a life free from shame and reproach, a life of prosperity and honor, a life in which the love of the Law and the fear of Heaven shall cleave to us, a life in which the desires of our heart shall be fulfilled for good.

{p. 221}

In many Congregations the following is said only on the Sabbaths preceding {sic "Pentcost" "Pentecost"} and the Fast of the Ninth of Ab:—

May the Father of mercies, who dwelleth on high in his mighty compassion, remember those loving, upright and blameless ones, the holy congregations, who laid down their lives for the sanctification of the divine name, who were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death were not divided; swifter than eagles, stronger than lions to do the will of their Master and the desire of their Rock. May our God remember them for good with the other righteous of the world, and avenge the blood of his servants which hath been shed; as it is written in the Law of Moses, the man of God, Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will make atonement for his land and for his people. And by the hands of thy servants, the prophets, it is written saying, I will cleanse their blood that I have not yet cleansed: for the Lord dwelleth in Zion. And in the Holy Writings it is said, Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let there be made known among the nations in our sight the revenging of the blood of thy servants which hath been shed. And it is said, For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. And it is further said, He judgeth among the nations; the land is full of corpses: he smiteth the head over a wide land. He drinketh of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.

Happy are they that dwell in thy house: they will be ever praising thee. (Selah.)

Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy is the people, whose God is the Lord.

Psalm cxlv. A Psalm of Praise: of David.

I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.

{p. 222}

Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.

Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.

One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.

On the majestic glory of thy grandeur, and on thy marvellous deeds, will I meditate.

And men shall speak of the might of thy awful acts; and I will recount thy greatness.

They shall pour forth the fame of thy great goodness, and shall exult in thy righteousness.

The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow to anger and of great lovingkindness.

The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.

All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and thy loving ones shall bless thee.

They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.

To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the majestic glory of his kingdom.

Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down.

The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in due season.

Thou openest thine hand and satisfiest every living thing with favor.

The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and loving in all his works.

{p. 223}

The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon hire to all that call upon him in truth.

He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them.

The Lord guardeth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.

My mouth shall speak of the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.

But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord.

On returning the Scroll of the Law to the Ark the Reader says:—

Let them praise the name of the Lord; for his name alone is exalted:

Congregation.—His grandeur is above the earth and heaven: and he hath lifted up a horn for his people, to the praise of all his loving ones, even of the children of Israel, the people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.

On Sabbaths and on Festivals occurring on Sabbaths say:—

Psalm xxix.

A Psalm of David. Give unto the Lord, O ye children of the mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth, even the Lord upon the great waters

{p. 224}

{cont}The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty. The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. The voice of the Lord cleaveth flames of fire; the voice of the Lord maketh the wilderness to tremble; the Lord maketh tremble the wilderness of Kadesh. The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to travail, and strippeth the forests bare: and in his temple everything saith, Glory. The Lord sat as king at the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth as king for ever. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.

On Festivals occurring on Week-days say:—

Psalm xxiv.

A Psalm of David. The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. For it is he that hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? And who may stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not set his desire upon vanity, and hath not sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of them that seek after him, that seek thy face (O God of) Jacob! (Selah.) Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your

{p. 225}

heads, O ye gates; yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. (Selah.)

While the Scroll of the Law is being placed in the Ark, the following to "as of old" is said:—

And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel. Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting place; thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy loving ones shout for joy. For the sake of David thy servant, turn not away the face of thine anointed. For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my Law. It is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one is rendered happy. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall return: renew our days as of old.

Reader.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

Cong. and Reader.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

Reader.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

On the Sabbath of Penitence conclude the last Blessing thus:—

$the holy King./$

{fr. *} Thou didst institute the Sabbath, and didst accept its offerings; thou didst command its special obligations with the order of its drink offerings. They that find delight in it shall inherit glory for everlasting; they that taste it are worthy of life; while such as love its teachings have chosen true greatness. Already from Sinai they were commanded concerning it; and thou hast also commanded us, O Lord our God,

{fn. *. On Sabbath and New Moon.

Thou didst form thy world from of old; thou hadst finished thy work on the seventh day; thou hast loved us and taken pleasure in us, hast exalted us above all tongues, hast sanctified us by thy commandments, hast brought us near, O our King unto thy service, and called us by thy great and holy name. Thou, O Lord our God, also gavest us in love Sabbaths for rest and New Moons for atonement. But because we sinned against thee, both we and our fathers, our city hath been laid waste, our sanctuary is desolate, our splendor hath gone into exile, and the glory hath been removed from the {fp. 230} house of our life, so that we are not able to perform our obligations in thy chosen house, in that great and holy house which was called by thy name, because of the hand that hath been stretched out against thy sanctuary. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to lead us up in joy unto our land, and to plant us within our borders, where we will prepare unto thee the offerings that are obligatory for us, the continual offerings according to their order, and the additional offerings according to their enactment; and the additional offerings of this Sabbath day and of this New Moon we will prepare and offer up unto thee in love, according to the precept of thy will, as thou hast {fp. 231} prescribed for us in thy Law through the hand of Moses thy servant, by the mouth of thy glory, as it is said: And on the Sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering and the drink offering thereof.

And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord; two young bullocks and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish. And their meal offering and their drink offerings as hath been ordained, three tenth parts of an ephah for each bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram, and one tenth part for each lamb, with wine according to the drink offering thereof, and a he-goat wherewith to make atonement, and the two continual offerings according to their enactment. {fp. 232}

They that keep the Sabbath and call it a delight shall rejoice in thy kingdom; the people that hallow the seventh day, even all of them shall be satiated and delighted with thy goodness, seeing that thou didst find pleasure in the seventh day, and didst hallow it; thon didst call it the desirable of days, in remembrance of the creation.

Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest, and on this Sabbath day renew this New Moon unto us for good and for blessing, for joy and for gladness, for salvation and comfort, for sustenance and maintenance, for life and peace, for pardon of sin and forgiveness of iniquity (during Leap Year:—{fp. 233} and for atonement of transgression); for thou hast chosen thy people Israel from among all nations, and hast made thy holy Sabbath known unto them, and hast appointed unto them statutes for the beginnings of the months. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest the Sabbath, Israel and the beginnings of the months.}

{p. 230}

to bring thereon the additional offering of the Sabbath as is meet. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to lead us up in joy unto our land, and to plant us within our borders, where we will prepare unto thee the offerings that are obligatory for us, the continual offerings according to their order, and the additional offerings according to their enactment; and the additional offering of this Sabbath day we will prepare and offer up unto thee in love, according to the precept of thy

{p. 231}

will, as thou hast prescribed for us in thy Law through the hand of Moses thy servant, by the mouth of thy glory, as it is said:

And on the Sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year, without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering and the drink offering thereof.

They that keep the Sabbath and call it a delight shall rejoice in thy kingdom; the people that hallow the seventh day, even all of them

{p. 232}

shall be satiated and delighted with thy goodness, seeing that thou didst find pleasure in the seventh day. and didst hallow it; thou didst call it the desirable of days, in remembrance of the creation.

Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest; sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness, and gladden us with thy salvation; purify our hearts to serve thee in truth; and in thy love and favor, O Lord our God, let

{p. 233}

us inherit thy holy Sabbath; and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rest thereon. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

And let our eyes behold thy return in mercy to Zion. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest thy divine presence unto Zion.

~Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace./~

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth

Talmud Babli: Treatise Cerithoth 6, a.

The compound forming the incense{fr. *} consisted of balm, onycha, galbanum and frankincense, in quantities weighing seventy manehs each; of myrrh, cassia, spikenard and saffron, each sixteen manehs by weight; of costus twelve, of aromatic bark three, and of cinnamon nine manehs; of lye obtained from a species of leek, nine kabs; of Cyprus wine three seahs and three kabs: though, if Cyprus wine was not procurable, old white wine might be used; of salt of Sodom the fourth part of a kab, and of the herb Maaleh Ashan a minute quantity. R. Nathan says, a minute quantity was also required of the odoriferous herb Cippath, that grew on the banks of the Jordan; if, however, one added honey to the mixture, he rendered the incense unfit for sacred use, while he who, in preparing it, omitted one of its necessary ingredients, was liable to the penalty of death. Rabban Simeon, son of Gamaliel, says, the balm is a resin that exudes from the wood of the balsam tree. The lye obtained from a species of leek was rubbed over the onycha to improve it, while the Cyprus wine was used to steep it in, so that its odor might be more pungent.

R. Eleazer said in the name of R. Chanina, The disciples of the sages increase peace throughout the world, as it is said, And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children. Read not here banayich, thy children (or disciples), but bonayich, thy builders.—Great peace have they who love thy Law; and there is no stumbling for them. Peace be within thy rampart, prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sake, I would fain speak peace concerning thee. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God I would seek thy good. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.

It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us

{p. 241}

like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else: in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glom; as it is written in thy Law, The Lord shall reign for ever

{p. 242}

and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.

The following Kaddish is said by a Mourner.

And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.

Mourner.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

Cong. and Mourner.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

He is Lord of the universe, who reigned ere any creature yet was formed:

At the time when all things were made by his desire, then was his name proclaimed King.

And after all things shall have had an end, he alone, the dreaded one, shall reign;

Who was, who is, and who will be in glory. And he is One, and there is no second to compare to him, to consort with him:

Without beginning, without end; to him belong strength and dominion.

And he is my God—my Redeemer liveth—and a rock in my travail in time of distress;

And he is my banner and my refuge, the portion of my cup on the day when I call.

Into his hand I commend my spirit, when I sleep and when I wake;

And with my spirit, my body also: the Lord is with me, and I will not fear.

UNITY HYMN FOR THE SABBATH DAY

In some Congregations the following is said before "Blessed be he who spake," {pr. 19}.

Of old thou didst rest on the seventh day; thou didst therefore bless the Sabbath.

For every work of thine praise is prepared for thee; thy loving ones bless thee at all times.

Blessed be the Lord, the Maker of them all, the living God and everlasting King.

For from of old there hath rested upon thy servants the abundance of thy mercies and thy loving kindnesses.

But in Egypt thou didst begin to make known that thou art exalted far.

Above all gods, when thou didst execute great judgment: upon the Egyptians and upon their gods.

{p. 244}

When thou didst cleave the Red Sea, thy people saw thy great hand, and they feared.

Thou didst guide thy people, so that thou mightest make unto thyself a name of glory to manifest thy greatness.

Thou spakest also with them from the heavens, when the clouds dropped water.

Thou knewest their wanderings in the wilderness, in a land of drought, where none passed through.

Thou gavest to thy people the corn of heaven, flesh abundant as the dust, and water from the rock.

Thou didst drive out many nations, and they took possession of their land and of the labor of the peoples;

That they might observe thy statutes and laws, the words of the Lord, which are pure words.

And they delighted themselves with fat pastures, and with rivers of oil from the flinty rock.

When they rested, they built thy holy city, and adorned the house of thy sanctuary.

Then thou saidst, Here will I dwell for length of days: I will surely bless her provision.

There they shall sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness; thy priests also shall be clothed with righteousness.

The house of Levi also shall chant pleasant songs; they shall shout for joy and sing unto thee.

The house of Israel and they that fear the Lord shall give glory and thanks unto thy name, O Lord.

Thou hast dealt out exceeding kindness to the earliest ages; deal thus kindly also with the latest.

O Lord, rejoice over us, even as thou didst rejoice over out fathers,

To multiply us and deal kindly with us; and we will for ever give thanks unto thee for thy goodness.

O Lord, rebuild thy city speedily, for it is called by thy name.

And make the horn of David to flourish therein, and dwell in the midst thereof for ever, O Lord.

There we will offer sacrifices of righteousness, and there may our oblation be pleasant as in former days.

{p. 245}

bless thy people with the light of thy countenance; for they desire to do thy will.

And in thy good will fulfil our desire; look, we beseech thee, we are thy people, all of us.

Thou hast chosen us to be unto thee a treasured people: let thy blessing be upon thy people for ever.

And we will continually declare thy praise, and praise thy glorious name.

Of thy blessing let thy people be blessed, for every one whom thou blessest is blessed.

As for me, while I have my being, I will praise my Creator, and I will bless him all the days of my appointed time.

Let the name of the Lord be blessed for ever, from everlasting even to everlasting.

As it is written: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord. Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his. And it is said: Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, Stand up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting: and let them bless thy glorious name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise. And it is said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen: praise ye the Lord. And it is said, And David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the congregation: and David said, blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of Israel our father, from everlasting to everlasting.

HYMN OF GLORY.

The Ark is opened and the following Hymn is chanted in alternate verses by the Reader and Congregation.

I will chant sweet hymns and compose songs; for my soul panteth after thee.

My soul hath longed to be beneath the shadow of thy hand, to know all thy secret mysteries.

Even whilst I speak of thy glory, my heart yearneth for thy love.

Therefore will I speak glorious things of thee, and will honor thy name with songs of love.

I will declare thy glory, though I have not seen thee; under images will I describe thee, though I have not known thee.

By the hand of thy prophets, in the mystic utterance of thy servants, thou hast imaged forth the grandeur and the glory of thy majesty.

Thy greatness and thy might they described in accordance with the power made manifest in thy acts.

In images they told of thee, but not according to thine essence; they but likened thee in accordance with thy works.

They figured thee in a multitude of visions; behold thou art One under all images.

They saw in thee both age and youth,{fr. *} the hair of thy head now grey as in old age, now black as in youth.

Age in the day of judgment, and youth in the day of battle; as a man of war he striveth with his hands:

He hath bound a helmet of victory upon his head; his right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought victory for him:

With dew of light his head is filled, and his locks with drops of the night.

He shall be glorified by me for he delighteth in me; yea, he shall be to me a crown of beauty.

His head is like fine, pure gold; upon his forehead is impressed the glory of his holy name.

{fn. *. In regard to these and the following expressions, compare Daniel vii. 9; Exod. xv. 3; Song of Solomon v. 2, 14; Isaiah lix. 17; Psalm xcviii. 1.}

{p. 247}

For grace and glory, beauty and splendor his people hath encircled him with a crown.

The plaited hair of his head seemed as in the days of youth, his black locks were flowing in curls.

The abode of righteousness—his glorious beauty—may he prefer it above his chiefest joy.

May his treasured people be a crown in his hand, a royal diadem of glorious beauty.

They were borne by him, he carried them; with a crown he adorned them; for that they were precious in his sight he honored them.

His glory resteth upon me, and mine upon him; and he is nigh unto me, when I cry unto him.

He is bright and ruddy in red apparel, when he cometh front treading the winepress in Edom.{fr. †}

The symbol of his all-embracing providence he showed to the meek Moses, when the similitude of the Lord was before his eyes.

Taking pleasure in his people, he will glorify the meek; that, dwelling amid praises, he may be glorified by them.

The sum of thy word is truth; O thou, who hast called every generation from the beginning, seek the people that seeketh thee.

Accept, I beseech thee, the multitude of my songs, and let my joyous cry come near unto thee.

Let my praise be a crown unto thy head, and my prayer be set forth before thee as incense.

Let the song of the poor be precious in thy sight as the song that was sung at thy offerings.

May my blessing rise to the bountiful God, who createth and produceth, who is just and mighty.

And when I bless thee, incline thine head unto me, and take what I offer as though it were the choicest spices.

May my meditation be pleasant unto thee, for my soul panteth after thee.

Psalm xcii.

A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath Day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: to declare thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, with an instrument of ten strings and with a harp, with thoughtful music upon the lyre. For thou, O Lord, hast made me rejoice through thy work: I will exult in the works of thy hands. How great are thy works, O Lord: the thoughts are very deep. A brutish man knoweth it not, neither doth a fool understand this: when the wicked sprang up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity flourished, it was that they might be destroyed for ever. But thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. But my horn hast thou exalted, like that of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies; mine ears have heard my desire of them that rose up against me, doers of evil. The righteous shall spring up like a palm-tree; he shall grow tall like a cedar in Lebanon. Planted in the house of the Lord, they shall blossom in the courts of our God. They shall still shoot forth in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to declare that the Lord is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever, that in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and ceased from his work.

Remember the sabbath day to {sic "kep" "keep"} it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is therein, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.

On the majestic glory of thy grandeur, and on thy marvellous deeds, will I meditate.

And men shall speak of the might of thy awful acts; and I will recount thy greatness.

They shall pour forth the fame of thy great goodness, and shall exult in thy righteousness.

The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow to anger and of great lovingkindness.

The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.

All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and thy loving ones shall bless thee.

They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.

To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the majestic glory of his kingdom.

{p. 251}

Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down.

The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest then. their food in due season.

Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest every living thing with favor.

The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and loving in all his works.

The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.

He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them.

The Lord guardeth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.

My mouth shall speak of the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.

But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord.

And a redeemer shall come to Zion and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: my spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.

{p. 252}

But thou art holy, O thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. {fr. *}And they receive sanction the one from the other, and say, Holy in the highest heavens, the place of his divine abode; holy upon earth, the work of his might; holy for ever and to all eternity is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of the radiance of his glory. Then a wind lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing (saying), Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place. {fr. *}Then a wind lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, of those who uttered praises, and said, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from the region of his divine abode. The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. {fr. *}The kingdom of the Lord endureth for ever and to all eternity. O Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their heart unto thee. Arid he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up all his wrath. For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and abounding in lovingkindness to all them that call upon thee. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy Law is truth. Thou wilt show truth to Jacob and loving kindness to Abraham, according as thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. Blessed be the Lord day by day; if one burdeneth us.

{fn. *. The Chaldee paraphrase of the preceding verse.}

{p. 253}

{cont}God is our salvation. (Selah.) The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah.) O Lord of hosts, happy is the man who trusteth in thee. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Blessed is our God, who hath created us for his glory, and hath separated us from them that go astray, and hath given us the Law of truth and planted everlasting life in our midst. May he open our heart unto his Law, and place his love and fear within our hearts, that we may do his will and serve him with a perfect heart, that we may not labor in vain, nor bring forth for confusion. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that we may keep thy statutes in this world, and be worthy to live to witness and inherit happiness and blessing in the days of the Messiah and in the life of the world to come. To the end that my glory may sing praise unto thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose trust the Lord is. Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in Jah the Lord is an everlasting rock. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, Lord. It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Law and to make it honorable.

Reader.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

{p. 254}

Cong. and Reader.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

Reader.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

And as for me, may my prayer unto thee, O Lord, be in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, answer me in the truth of thy salvation.

The first section of the Lesson from the Pentateuch of the following Sabbath is read.

For Order of Reading the Law see pp. {prr. 81}–87.

While the vestments are being replaced upon the Scroll, Psalm, xcii., {pr. 248}, is said.

The following prayer (Amidah) to "as in ancient years," {pr. 260}, is to be said standing.

O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses, and possessest all things; who rememberest the pious deeds of the patriarchs, and in love wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.

During the Ten Days of Penitence say:

Remember us unto life, O King, who delightest in life, and inscribe us in the book of life, for thine own sake, O living God.

{p. 255}

O King, Helper, Savior and Shield. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the Shield of Abraham.

Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art mighty to save.

From the Sabbath after the Eighth Day of Solemn Assembly until the First Day of Passover say:—

Thou causest the wind to blow and the rain to fall,

Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest and causest salvation to spring forth?

On the Sabbath of Penitence say:

Who is like unto thee, Father of mercy, who in mercy rememberest thy creatures unto life?

Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead. * (See page {prr. 256}).

Thou art holy, and thy name is holy, and holy beings praise thee daily. (Selah.) Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.

On the Sabbath of Penitence conclude the Blessing thus:

$the holy King./$

{p. 256}

When the Reader repeats the Amidah, the following is said, to "holy God."

* Reader.—We will sanctify thy name in the world even as they sanctify it in the highest heavens, as it is written by the hand of thy prophet: And they called one unto the other and said,

Cong.—Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

Reader.—Those over against them say, Blessed—

Cong.—Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.

Reader.—And in thy Holy Words it is written, saying,

Cong.—The Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

Reader.—Unto all generations we will declare thy greatness, and to all eternity we will proclaim thy holiness, and thy praise, O our God, shall not depart from our mouth for ever, for thou art a great and holy God and King. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.

During the Ten Days of Penitence conclude the Blessing thus:—

$the holy King./$

Thou art One and thy name is One, and who, is like thy people Israel, an unique nation on the earth? Glorious greatness and a crown of salvation, even the day of rest and holiness, thou hast given unto thy people:—Abraham was glad, Isaac rejoiced, Jacob and his sons rested thereon:—a rest vouchsafed in generous love, a true and faithful rest, a rest in peace and tranquillity,

{p. 257}

in quietude and safety, a perfect rest wherein thou delightest. Let thy children perceive and know that this their rest is from thee, and by their rest may they hallow thy name.

Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest; sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness, and gladden us with thy salvation; purify our hearts to serve thee in truth; and in thy love and favor, O Lord our God, let us inherit thy holy Sabbath; and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rest thereon. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

On New Moon and the Intermediate Days of Passover and Tabernacles the following is added:—

Our God and God of our fathers! May our remembrance rise, come and be accepted before thee, with the remembrance of our fathers, of Messiah the son of David thy servant, of Jerusalem thy holy city, and of all thy people the house of Israel, bringing deliverance

{p. 258}

and well-being, grace, lovingkindness and mercy, life and peace on this day of

On New Moon—

$the Feast of the New Moon./$

On Passover—

$the Feast of Unleavened Bread./$

On Tabernacles—

$Tabernacles./$

{cont}Remember us, O Lord our God, thereon for our wellbeing; be mindful of us for blessing, and save us unto life: by thy promise of salvation and mercy, spare us and be gracious unto us; have mercy upon us and save us; for our eyes are bent upon thee, because thou art a gracious and merciful God and King.

And let our eyes behold thy return in mercy to Zion. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest thy divine presence unto Zion.

We give thanks unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God and the God of our fathers for ever and ever; thou art the Rock of our lives, the Shield of our salvation through every generation. We will give thanks unto thee and declare thy praise for our lives which are committed unto thy hand, and for our souls which are in thy charge, and for thy miracles, which are daily with us, and for

Congregation in an undertone

|$We give thanks unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God and the God of our fathers, the God of all flesh, our Creator and the Creator of all things in the beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings be to thy great and holy name because thou hast kept us in life and hast preserved us: so mayest thou continue to keep us in life and to preserve us. O gather our exiles to thy holy courts to observe thy statutes, to do thy will, and to serve thee with a perfect heart; seeing that we give thanks unto thee. Blessed be the God to whom thanksgivings are due./$/|

{p. 259}

thy wonders and thy benefits, which are wrought at all times, evening, morn and noon. O thou who art all-good, whose mercies fail not; thou, merciful Being, whose lovingkindnesses never cease, we have ever hoped in thee.

On Sabbath of Chanukah say: We thank thee, etc., {pr. 63}.

For all these things thy name, O our King, shall be continually blessed and exalted for ever and ever.

On the Sabbath of Penitence say:—

O inscribe all the children of thy covenant for a happy life.

And everything that liveth shall give thanks unto thee for ever, and shall praise thy name in truth, O God, our salvation and our help. Blessed art thou, O Lord, whose name is All-good, and unto whom it is becoming to give thanks.

Grant abundant peace unto Israel thy people for ever; for thou art the sovereign Lord of all peace; and may it be good in thy sight to bless thy people Israel at all times and in every hour with thy peace.

On the Sabbath of Penitence say:—

In the book of life, blessing, peace and good sustenance may we be remembered and inscribed before thee, we and all thy people the house of Israel, for a happy life and for peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest peace.

Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace.

{p. 260}

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.

$May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years./$

The following is omitted on such occasions as those on which Tachanun is omitted on Week-days:—

Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy Law is truth. Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high; thou who hast done great things, O God,

{p. 261}

who is like unto thee? Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy judgments are a great deep man and beast thou savest, O Lord.

Reader.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

Cong. and Reader.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

Reader.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

Cong.—Accept our prayer in mercy and in favor.

Cong.—My help is from Lord who made heaven and earth.

Reader.—He who maketh peace in his high places. may he make peace for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

{p. 262}

It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else: in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever

{p. 263}

and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.

The following Kaddish is said by a Mourner

Mourner.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

Cong. and Mourner.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

Mourner.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

Cong.—Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore.

Mourner.—May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

Cong.—My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

Mourner.—He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

{p. 264}

From the Sabbath after "the Rejoicing of the Law" until the Sabbath before Passover, the following Psalms are read:—

Psalm civ.

Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou hast robed thee in splendor and majesty. He covereth himself with light as with a garment; he stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain: he layeth the beams of his upper chambers in the waters; he maketh the clouds his chariot; he walketh upon the wings of the wind. He maketh winds his messengers; his ministers flaming fire: he founded the earth upon its bases, that it might not be moved for ever. Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. The mountains rose, the valleys sank unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; they run among the mountains. They give drink to every beast of the plain; the wild asses quench their thirst. By them the birds of the heaven have their dwelling, they utter their voice from among the branches. He giveth drink to the mountains from his upper chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. He causeth grass to grow for the cattle, and herbs for the service of man; that he may bring forth bread from the earth; and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the Lord are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted; where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies. He made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth its going down. Thou makest darkness, and it is night; wherein all the beasts of the forest do move. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God. The sun ariseth, they get them

{p. 265}

away, and lay them down in their dens. Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labor until the evening How manifold are thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy possessions. Yonder is the sea, great and of wide extern therein are moving things innumerable, living creatures both small and great. There the ships make their course; there is leviathan whom thou hast formed to sport therein. These all wait upon thee, that thou mayest give them their food in due season. Thou givest unto them, they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good. Thou hidest thy face, they are confounded; thou gatherest in their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the ground. Let the glory of the Lord endure for ever; let the Lord rejoice in his works. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. May my meditation be sweet unto him: as for me, I will rejoice in the Lord. Sinners shall be consumed out of the earth, and the wicked shall be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul: praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxx.

A Song of Degrees. In my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he answered me. Deliver my soul, O Lord, from a lying lip, and from a deceitful tongue. What shall he give unto thee, and what shall he add unto thee, thou deceitful tongue? Sharpened arrows of a mighty man with coals of juniper. Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar. My soul hath full long had her dwelling with him that hateth peace. I am all peace; but when I speak, they are for war.

Psalm cxxi.

A Song of Degrees. I lift up mine eyes unto the hills: whence will my help come? My help is

{p. 266}

from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to slip: he that guardeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that guardeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy guardian: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall guard thee from all evil; he shall guard thy soul. The Lord shall guard thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth and for evermore.

Psalm cxxii.

A Song of Degrees; of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of the Lord. Our feet stood within thy gates, O Jerusalem; Jerusalem that art built up as a city that is compact together: whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord, for a testimony unto Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may they prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy rampart, prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes I would fain speak peace concerning thee. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God I would seek thy good.

Psalm cxxiii.

A Song of Degrees. Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until he have pity upon us. Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: for we are full sated with contempt. Our soul is full sated with the mocking of those that are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.

Psalm cxxiv.

A Song of Degrees; of David. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, let Israel now say:

{p. 267}

if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us, then they had swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul; then the proud waters had gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth. Our soul escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare was broken, and we escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

Psalm cxxv.

A Song of Degrees. They that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. The mountains are round about Jerusalem, and the Lord is round about his people, from this time forth and for evermore. For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity. Dc good, O Lord, unto those that are good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord will destroy them with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.

Psalm cxxvi.

A Song of Degrees. When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like unto them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with exultation: then said they among the nations, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereat we rejoiced. Bring back our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south. They that sow, in tears shall reap in joy. Though he goeth on his way weeping, hearing the store of seed, he shall come back with joy, bearing his sheaves.

{p. 268}

Psalm cxxvii.

A Song of Degrees; of Solomon. Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord watch over the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. It is vain for you to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of toil: such things he giveth unto his beloved in sleep. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them: they shall not be ashamed, when they speak with enemies in the gate.

Psalm cxxviii.

A Song of Degrees. Happy is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways. When thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the recesses of thine house: thy children like olive plants, round about thy table. Behold thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord. May the Lord bless thee out of Zion: mayest thou see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. Yea, mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.

Psalm cxxix.

A Song of Degrees. To the full have they afflicted me from my youth up, let Israel now say; to the full have they afflicted me from my youth up: yet have they not prevailed against me. The plower; plowed upon my back, they made long their furrows. The Lord is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all they that hate Zion. Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth before it shooteth forth: wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom: neither do

{p. 269}

they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.

Psalm cxxx.

A Song of Degrees. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord, more than watchmen wait for the morning; yea, more than watchmen for the morning. O let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is lovingkindness, and with him is plenteous deliverance. And he shall deliver Israel from all his iniquities.

Psalm cxxxi.

A Song of Degrees; of David. Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too marvellous for me. Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother; my soul is with me like a weaned child. O Israel, hope in the Lord from this time forth and for evermore.

Psalm cxxxii.

A Song of Degrees. Lord, remember for David all his affliction; how he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, nor go up unto the couch of my rest; I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids; until I find out a place for the Lord, a habitation for the Mighty One of Jacob. Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah: we found it in the fields of Jaar. Let us go into his habitation; let us worship

{p. 270}

at his footstool. Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting place; thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy loving ones exult. For the sake of David thy servant turn not away the face of thine anointed. The Lord hath sworn unto David in truth—he will not turn from it—: of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore. For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my resting-place for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her needy with bread. Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; and her loving ones shall exult aloud. There will I make a horn to spring forth unto David: I have prepared a lamp for mine anointed. His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon him his crown shall shine.

Psalm cxxxiii.

A Song of Degrees; of David. Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the goodly oil upon the head, that runneth down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard; that runneth down upon the skirt of his garments; like the dew of Hermon, that runneth down upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commandment the blessing, even life for evermore.

Psalm cxxxiv.

A Song of Degrees. Behold, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord in the night seasons. Lift up your hands towards the sanctuary, and bless ye the Lord. The Lord bless thee out of Zion; even he that made heaven and earth.

ETHICS OF THE FATHERS.

One of the following chapters is read on each Sabbath from the Sabbath after Passover until the Sabbath before New Year.

$All Israel have a portion in the world to come, as it is said (Isaiah lx, 21), And thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified./$

<Chapter> I.

(1.) Moses received the Torah{fr. *} on Sinai, and handed it down to Joshua; Joshua to the elders; the elders to the prophets; and the prophets handed it down to the men of the Great Synagogue. They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment; raise up many disciples, and make a fence round the Torah. (2.) Simon the Just was one of the last survivors of the Great Synagogue. He used to say, Upon three things the world is based: upon the Torah, upon the Temple service, and upon the practice of charity. (3.) Antigonos of Socho received the tradition from Simon the Just. He used to say, Be not like servants who minister to their master upon the condition of receiving a reward; but be like servants who minister to their master without the condition of receiving a reward; and let the fear of Heaven be upon you. (4.) José, the son of Joezer, of Zeredah, and José, the son of Jochanan, of Jerusalem, received the tradition from the preceding. José, the son of Joezer, of Zeredah, said, Let thy house be a meeting house for the wise; sit amidst the dust of their feet, and drink their words with thirst. (5.) José, the son of Jochanan, of Jerusalem, said, Let thy house be open wide; let the poor be the members of thy household,

and engage not in much gossip with women. This applies even to one's own wife; how much more then to the wife of one's neighbor. Hence the sages say, Whoso engages in much gossip with women brings evil upon himself, neglects the study of the Torah, and will in the end inherit Gehinnom. (6.) Joshua, the son of Perachyah, and Nittai, the Arbelite, received the tradition from the preceding. Joshua, the son of Perachyah, said, Provide thyself a teacher, and get thee a companion, and judge all men in the scale of merit. (7.) Nittai, the Arbelite, said, Keep thee far from a bad neighbor, associate not with the wicked, and abandon not the belief in retribution. (8.) Judah, the son of Tabbai, and Simeon, the son of Shatach, received the tradition from the preceding. Judah, the son of Tabbai, said, (In the judge's office) act not the counsel's part; when the parties to a suit are standing before thee, let them both be regarded by thee as guilty, but when they are departed from thy presence, regard them both as innocent, the verdict having been acquiesced in by them. (9.) Simeon, the son of Shatach, said, Be very searching in the examination, of witnesses, and be heedful of thy words, lest through them they learn to falsify. (10.) Shemayah and Abtalyon received the tradition from the preceding. Shemayah said, Love work, hate lordship, and seek no intimacy with the ruling power (11.) Abtalyon said, Ye sages, be heedful of your words, lest ye incur the penalty of exile and be exiled to a place of evil waters, and the disciples who come after you drink thereof and die, and the Heavenly Name be profaned. (12.) Hillel and Shammai received the tradition from the preceding. Hillel said, Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving thy fellow-creatures, and drawing them near to the Torah. (13.) He

{p. 273}

used to say, A name made great is a name destroyed; he who does not increase his knowledge decreases it; and he who does not study deserves to die; and he who makes a worldly use of the crown of the Torah shall waste away. (14.) He used to say, If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And being for my own self, what am I? And if not now, when? (15). Shammai said, Fix a period for thy study of the Torah; say little and do much; and receive all men with a cheerful countenance. (16.) Rabban Gamaliel said, Provide thyself a teacher, and be quit of doubt, and accustom not thyself to give tithes by a conjectural estimate. (17.) Simeon, his son, said, All my days I have grown up amongst the wise, and I have found nought of better service than silence; not learning but doing is the chief thing; and whoso is profuse of words causes sin. (18.) Rabban Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, said, By three things is the world preserved: by truth, by judgment, and by peace, as it is said, Judge ye the truth and the judgment of peace in your gates (Zech. viii. 16).

$Rabbi Chananya, the son of Akashya, said, The Holy One, blessed be he, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore he gave them a copious Torah and many commandments, as it is said, It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Torah and make it honorable (Isaiah xlii, 21)./$

<Chapter> II.

$All Israel have a portion in the world to come, as it is said (Isaiah lx. 21), And thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified./$

(1.) Rabbi said, Which is the right course that a man should choose for himself? That which he feels to be honorable to himself, and which also brings him honor from mankind.

{p. 274}

{cont}Be heedful of a light precept as of a grave one, for thou knowest not the grant of reward for each precept. Reckon the loss incurred by the fulfilment of a precept against the reward secured by its observance, and the gain gotten by a transgression against the loss it involves. Reflect upon three things, and thou wilt not come within the power of sin; Know what is above thee—a seeing eye, and a hearing ear, and all thy deeds written in a book. (2.) Rabban Gamaliel, the son of Rabbi Judah the Prince, said, An excellent thing is the study of the Torah combined with some worldly occupation, for the labor demanded by them both makes sin to be forgotten. All study of the Torah without work must in the end be futile and become the cause of sin. Let all who are employed with the congregation act with them for Heaven's sake, for then the merit of their fathers sustains them, and their righteousness endures for ever. And as for you, (God will then say,) I account you worthy of great reward, as if you had wrought it all yourselves. (3.) Be on your guard against the ruling power; for they who exercise it draw no man near to them except for their own interests; appearing as friends when it is to their own advantage, they stand not by a man in the hour of his need. (4.) He used to say, Do His will as if it were thy will, that He may do thy will as if it were His will. Nullify thy will before His will, that He may nullify the will of others before thy will. (5) Hillel said, Separate not thyself from the congregation; trust not in thyself until the day of thy death; judge not thy neighbor until thou art come into his place; and say not anything which cannot be understood at once, in the hope that it will be understood in the end; neither say, When I have leisure I will study; perchance thou wilt have no leisure. (6.) He used to say, An empty-headed man cannot be a sinfearing man, nor can an ignorant person be pious, nor can a shamefaced man learn, nor a passionate man teach, nor

{p. 275}

can one who is engaged overmuch in business grow wise. In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man. (7.) Moreover, he saw a skull floating on the surface of the water: he said to it, Because thou drownedst others, they have drowned thee, and at the last they that drowned thee shall themselves be drowned. (8.) He used to say, The more flesh, the more worms; the more property, the more anxiety; the more women, the more witchcraft; the more maid-servants, the more lewdness; the more men-servants, the more robbery;—the more Torah, the more life; the more schooling, the more wisdom; the more counsel, the more understanding; the more charity, the more peace. He who has acquired a good name, has acquired it for himself; he who has acquired for himself words of Torah, has acquired for himself life in the world to come. (9.) Rabban Jochanan, the son of Zacchai. received the tradition from Hillel and Shammai. He used to say, if thou hast learnt much Torah, ascribe not any merit to thyself, for thereunto wast thou created. (10.) Rabban Jochanan, the son of Zacchai, had five disciples, and these are they, Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Hyrcanus, Rabbi Joshua, the son of Chananya, Rabbi José, the Priest, Rabbi Simeon, the son of Nathaniel, and Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Arach. (11.) He used thus to recount their praise: Eliezer, the son of Hyrcanus, is a cemented cistern, which loses not a drop; Joshua, the son of Chananya—happy is she that bare him; José, the Priest, is a pious man; Simeon, the son of Nathaniel, is a fearer of sin; Eleazar, the son of Arach, is like a spring flowing {sic "wth" "with"} ever-sustaining vigor. (12.) He used to say, If all the sages of Israel were in one scale of the balance, and Eliezer, the son of Hyrcanus, in the other, he would outweigh them all. Abba Saul said in his name, If all the sages of

{p. 276}

{cont}Israel were in one scale of the balance, and Eliezer, the son of Hyrcanus, also with them, and Eleazar, the son of Arach, in the other scale, he would outweigh them all. (13.) He said to them, Go forth and see which is the good way to which a man should cleave. R. Eliezer said, A good eye; R. Joshua said, A good friend; R. José said, A good neighbor; R. Simeon said, One who foresees the fruit of an action; R. Eleazar said, A good heart. Thereupon he said to them, I approve the words of Eleazar, the son of Arach, rather than your words, for in his words yours are included. (14.) He said to them, Go forth and see which is the evil way that a man should shun. R. Eliezer said, An evil eye; R. Joshua said, A bad friend; R. José said, A bad neighbor; R. Simeon said, One who borrows and does not repay,—it is the same whether one borrows from man or from the all-present God; as it is said, The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again, but the righteous dealeth graciously and giveth (Psalm xxxvii. 21); R. Eleazar said, A bad heart. Thereupon he said to them, I approve the words of Eleazar, the son of Arach, rather than your words, for in his words yours are included. (15.) They each said three things. R. Eliezer said, Let thy friend's honor be as dear to thee as thine own; and be not easily moved to anger; and repent one day before thy death. And (he further said), Warm thyself by the fire of the wise; but beware of their glowing coals, lest thou be burnt, for their bite is the bite of the fox, and their sting is the scorpion's sting, and their hiss is the serpent's hiss, and all their words are like coals of fire.{fr. *} (16.) R. Joshua said, The evil eye, the evil inclination, and hatred of his fellow-creatures put a

{fn. *. The highest gifts, if abused, may prove a source of suffering to those whom they are designed to benefit.}

{p. 277}

man out of the world. (17.) R. José said, Let the property of thy friend be as dear to thee as thine own; qualify thyself for the study of the Torah, since the knowledge of it is not an inheritance of thine, and let all thy deeds be done for the sake of Heaven. (18.) R. Simeon said, Be careful to read the Shema’ and to say the Amidah; and when thou prayest, regard not thy prayer as a fixed mechanical task, but as an appeal for mercy and grace before the All-present, as it is said, For he is gracious and full of mercy, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil (Joel ii. 13); and be not wicked in thine own esteem. (19.) R. Eleazar said, Be watchful in the study of the Torah, and know what answer to give to the unbeliever; know also before whom thou toilest, and who thy Employer is, who will pay thee the reward of thy labor. (20.) Rabbi Tarphon said. The day is short, and the work is great, and the laborers are sluggish, and the reward is much, and the Master of the house is urgent. (21.) He used also to say, It is not thy duty to complete the work, but neither art thou free to desist from it; if thou hast studied much Torah, much reward will be given thee; and faithful is thy Employer to pay thee the reward of thy labor; and know that the grant of reward unto the righteous will be in the time to come.

Rabbi Chananya, the son of Akashya, said, The Holy One, blessed be he, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore he gave them a copious Torah and many commandments, as it is said, It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Torah and make it honorable (Isaiah xlii. 21).

<Chapter> III.

All Israel have a portion in the world to come, as it is said (Isaiah lx. 21), And thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

(1.) Akabya, the son of Mahalalel, said, Reflect upon three things, and thou wilt not come within the power of sin: know whence thou camest, and whither thou art going, and before whom thou wilt in future have to give account and reckoning. Whence thou earnest:—from a putrefying drop; whither thou art going:—to a place of dust, worms and maggots; and before whom thou wilt in future have to give account and reckoning:—before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he. (2.) R. Chanina, the Vice-High-Priest, said, Pray for the welfare of the government, since but for the year thereof men would swallow each other alive. (3.) R. Chananya, the son of Teradyon, said, If two sit together and interchange no words of Torah, they are a meeting of scorners, concerning whom it is said, The godly man sitteth not in the seat of the scorners (Ps. i. 1); but if two sit together and interchange words of Torah, the Divine Presence abides between them; as it is said, Then they that feared the Lord snake one with the other: and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name (Mal. iii. 16). Now, the Scripture enables me to draw this inference in respect to two persons; whence can it be deduced that if even one person sedulously occupies himself with the Torah, the Holy One, blessed be he, appoints unto him a reward? Because it is said, Though he sit alone, and meditate in stillness, yet he taketh it (the reward) upon him (Lam. iii. 27).{fr. *} (4.) R. Simeon said, If three have eaten at a table and have spoken there no words of Torah, it is as if they had eaten

{fn. *. Where biblical verses are employed not in a strictly literal sense, it is to be observed that the Rabbis, like other preachers, made use of such passages for homiletical purposes, as illustrations of their meaning rather than as logical foundations for their teaching. It was felt that additional weight would attach to any opinion with which some point of contact could he found in the Scriptures.}

{p. 279}

of sacrifices to dead idols, of whom it is said, For all their tables are full of vomit and filthiness; the All-present is not (in their thoughts) (Isa. xxviii. 8). But if three have eaten at a table and have spoken there words of Torah, it is as if they had eaten at the table of the All-present, to which the Scripture may be applied, And he said unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord (Ezek. xli. 22). (5.) R. Chanina, the son of Chachinai, said, He who keeps awake at night, and goes on his way alone, while turning his heart to vanity, such a one forfeits his own life. (6.) R. Nechunya, son of Hakkanah, said, Whoso receives upon himself the yoke of the Torah, from him the yoke of the kingdom and the yoke of worldly care will be removed; but whoso breaks off from him the yoke of the Torah, upon him will be laid the yoke of the kingdom and the yoke of worldly care. (7.) R. Chalafta, the son of Dosa, of the village of Chananya, said, When ten people sit together and occupy themselves with the Torah, the Shechinah abides among them, as it is said, God standeth in the congregation{fr. *} of the godly (Psalm lxxxii. 1). And whence can it be shown that the same applies to five? Because it is said, He hath founded his band{fr. †} upon the earth (Amos ix. 6). And whence can it be shown that the same applies to three? Because it is said, He judgeth among the judges{fr. ‡} (Psa. lxxxii. 1). And whence can it be shown that the same applies to two? Because it is said, Then they that feared the Lord spake one with the other; and the Lord hearkened, and heard (Mal. iii. 16). And whence can it be shown that the same applies even to one? Because it is said, In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come unto thee and I will bless thee (Exod. xx. 24). (8.) R. Eleazar, of Bertotha, said, Give unto Him of what is His, seeing that thou and what thou hast are His: this is also found expressed by David, who said, For all things come of Thee, and of Thine own we have given Thee (1 Chron. xxix. 14). (9.) R. Jacob said, He who is walking by the way and studying, and breaks off his study and says, How fine is that tree, how fine is that fallow, him the Scripture regards as if he had forfeited his life. (10.) R. Dostai, the son of Jannai, said

{fn. *. Ten are the minimum to form a "congregation" (Edah).}

{fn. †. Five, the minimum to constitute a "band" (Aguddah).}

{fn. ‡. The smallest judicial tribunal was composed of three judges.}

{p. 280}

in the name of R. Meir, Whoso forgets one word of his study, him the Scripture regards as if he had forfeited his life, for it is said, Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen (Deut. iv. 9). Now, one might suppose that the same result follows even if a man's study has been too hard for him. To guard against such an inference, it is said (ibid.), And lest they depart from thy mouth all the days of thy life. Thus, a person's guilt is not established until he deliberately and of set purpose removes those lessons from his heart. (11.) R. Chanina, the son of Dosa, said, He in whom the fear of sin comes before wisdom, his wisdom shall endure; but he in whom wisdom comes before the fear of sin, his wisdom will not endure. (12.) He used to say, He whose works exceed his wisdom, his wisdom shall endure; but he whose wisdom exceeds his works, his wisdom will not endure. (13.) He used to say, He in whom the spirit of his fellow-creatures takes delight, in him the Spirit of the All-present takes delight; and he in whom the spirit of his fellow-creatures takes not delight, in him the Spirit of the All-present takes not delight. (14.) R. Dosa, the son of Horkinas, said Morning sleep, and midday wine, and children's talk, and attending the houses of assembly of the ignorant put a man out of the world. (15.) R. Eleazar Hammudai said, He who profanes things sacred, and despises the festivals, and puts his fellow-man to shame in public, and makes void the covenant of Abraham our father, and makes the Torah bear a meaning other than the right, such a one, even though knowledge of the Torah and good deeds be his, has no share in the world to come. (16.) R. Ishmael said, Be submissive to a superior, affable to a suppliant, and receive all men with

{p. 281}

cheerfulness. (17.) R. Akiba said, Jesting and levity lead a man on to lewdness. The Massorah{fr. *} is a fence to the Torah. tithes are a fence to riches; vows are a fence to abstinence; a fence to wisdom is silence. (18.) He used to say, Beloved is man, for he was created in the image of God; but it was by a special love that it was made known to him that he was created in the image of God, as it is said, For in the image of God made he man (Gen. ix. 6). Beloved are Israel, for they were called children of the All-present; but it was by a special love that it was made known to them that they were called children of the All-present, as it is said, Ye are children unto the Lord your God (Deut. xiv. 1). Beloved are Israel, for unto them was given the desirable instrument; but it was by a special love that it was made known to them that that desirable instrument was theirs, through which the world was created, as it is said, For I give you good doctrine: forsake ye not my Law (Prov. iv. 2). (19.) Everything is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is given; and the world is judged by grace, yet all is according to the amount of the work. (20.) He used to say, Everything is given on pledge, and a net is spread for all the living: the shop is open; and the dealer gives credit; and the ledger lies open; and the hand writes; and whosoever wishes to borrow may come and borrow; but the collectors regularly make their daily round, and exact payment from man whether he be content or not, and they have that whereon they can rely in their demand, and the judgment is a judgment of truth; and everything is prepared for the feast. (21.) R. Eleazar, the son of Azaryah, said, Where there is no Torah, there are no manners; where there are no manners, there is no Torah: where there is no wisdom, there is no fear of God; where there is no fear of God, there is no wisdom; where there is no knowledge, there is no understanding; where there is no understanding, there is no

{fn. *. The oral tradition, in accordance with which the text of the Scriptures is determined and interpreted.}

{p. 282}

knowledge: where there is no meal, there is no Torah; where there is no Torah, there is no meal. (22.) He used to say, He whose wisdom exceeds his works, to what is he like? To a tree whose branches are many, but whose roots are few; and the wind comes and plucks it up and overturns it upon its face, as it is said, And he shall be like a lonely juniper tree in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited (Jeremiah xvii. 6). But he whose works exceed his wisdom, to what is he like? To a tree whose branches are few, but whose roots are many, so that even if all the winds in the world come and blow upon it, it cannot be stirred from its place, as it is said, And he shall be as a tree planted by the waters; and that spreadeth out its roots by the river, and shall not perceive when heat cometh, but his leaf shall be green; and shall not be troubled in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit (Jeremiah xvii. 8). (23.) R. Eleazar Chisma said, The laws concerning the sacrifices of birds and the purification of women are ordinances of moment; astronomy and geometry are the after-courses of wisdom.

Rabbi Chananya, the son of Akashya, said, The Holy One, blessed be he, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore he gave them a copious Torah and many commandments, as it is said, It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Torah and make it honorable (Isaiah xlii. 21).

<Chapter> IV.

All Israel have a portion in the world to come, as it is said (Isaiah lx. 21), And thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

(1.) Ben Zoma said, Who is wise? He who learns from

{p. 283}

all men, as it is said, From all my teachers I have gotten understanding (Psalm cxix. 99). Who is mighty? He who subdues his passions, as it is said, He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth over his spirit than he that taketh a city (Prov. xvi. 32). Who is rich? He who rejoices in his portion, as it is said, When thou eatest the labor of thine hands, happy art thou, and it shall be well with thee (Psalm cxxviii. 2); happy art thou in this world, and it shall be well with thee in the world to come. Who is honored? He who honors others, as it is said, For them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be held in contempt (1 Sam. ii. 30). (2.) Ben Azzai said, Run to do even a slight precept, and flee from transgression; for precept draws precept in its train, and transgression, transgression; for the recompense of a precept is a precept, and the recompense of a transgression, a transgression. (3.) He used to say, Despise not any man, and carp not at any thing; for there is not a man that has not his hour, and there is not a thing that has not its place. (4.) R. Levitas, of Jabneh, said, Be exceedingly lowly of spirit, since the hope of man is but the worm. (5.) R. Jochanan, the son of Berokah, said, Whosoever profanes the Name of Heaven in secret will suffer the penalty for it in public; and this, whether the Heavenly Name be profaned in ignorance or in wilfulness. (6.) R. Ishmael, his son, said, He who learns in order to teach, to him the means will be vouchsafed both to learn and to teach; but he who learns in order to practice, to him the means will be vouchsafed to learn and to teach, to observe and to practice. (7.) R. Zadok said, Separate not thyself from the congregation; (in the judge's office) act not the counsel's part; make not of the Torah a crown wherewith to aggrandise thyself, nor a spade wherewith to dig. So also used Hillel to say, He who makes a worldly use of the crown of the Torah shall waste away. Hence thou mayest infer, that whosoever derives a profit for himself from the words of the Torah is

{p. 284}

helping on his own destruction. (8.) R. José said, Whoso honors the Torah will himself be honored by mankind, but whoso dishonors the Torah will himself be dishonored by mankind. (9.) R. Ishmael, his son, said, He who shuns the judicial office rids himself of hatred, robbery and vain swearing; but he who presumptuously lays down {sic "decisons" "decisions"} is foolish, wicked and of an arrogant spirit. (10.) He used to say, Judge not alone, for none may judge alone save One; neither say (to thy judicial colleagues), Accept my view, for the choice is theirs (to concur); and it is not for thee (to compel concurrence). (11.) R. Jonathan said, Whoso fulfils the Torah in the midst of poverty shall in the end fulfil it in the midst of wealth; and whoso neglects the Torah in the midst of wealth shall in the end neglect it in the midst of poverty. (12.) R. Meir said, Lessen thy toil for worldly goods, and be busy in the Torah; be humble of spirit before all men; if thou neglectest the Torah, many causes for neglecting it will present themselves to thee, but if thou laborest in the Torah, He has abundant recompense to give thee. (13.) R. Eliezer, the son of Jacob, said, He who does one precept has gotten himself one advocate; and he who commits one transgression has gotten himself one accuser. Repentance and good deeds are as a shield against punishment. (14.) R. Jochanan, the sandal maker, said, Every assembly which is in the Name of Heaven will in the end be established, but that which is not in the Name of Heaven will not in the end be established. (15.) R. Eleazar, the son of Shammua, said, Let the honor of thy disciple be as dear to thee as thine own, and the honor of thine associate be like the fear of thy master, and the fear of thy master like the fear of Heaven. (16.) Judah said, Be cautious in study, for an error in study may

{p. 285}

amount to presumptuous sin. (17.) R. Simeon said, There are three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of kingdom; but the crown of a good name excels them all. (18.) R. Nehorai said, Wander forth to a home of the Torah, and say not that the Torah will come after thee; for there thy associates will establish thee in the possession of it; and lean not upon thine own understanding. (19.) R. Jannai said, It is not in our power to explain either the prosperity of the wicked or the afflictions of the righteous. (20.) R. Mattithyah, the son of Cheresh, said, Be beforehand in the salutation of peace to all men; and be rather a tail to lions than a head to foxes. (21.) R. Jacob said, This world is like a vestibule before the world to come; prepare thyself in the vestibule, that thou mayest enter into the hall. (22.) He used to say, Better is one hour of repentance and good deeds in this world than the whole life of the world to come; and better is one hour of blissfulness of spirit in the world to come than the whole life of this world (23.) R. Simeon, the son of Eleazar, said, Do not appease thy fellow in the hour of his anger, and comfort him not in the hour when his dead lies before him, and question him not in the hour of his vow, and strive not to see him in the hour of his disgrace. (24.) Samuel the younger used to quote, Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: lest the Lord see it and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him (Prov. xxiv. 17, 18). (25.) Elisha, the son of Abuyah, said, If one learns as a child, what is it like? Like ink written on clean paper. If one learns as an old man, what is it like? Like ink written on blotted paper.

{p. 286}

{cont}(26.) R. José, the son of Judah, of Chephar Babli, said, He who learns from the young, to what is he like? To one who eats unripe grapes, and drinks wine from his vat. And he who learns from the old, to what is he like? To one who eats ripe grapes, and drinks old wine. (27.) R. Meir said, Look not at the flask, but at what it contains: there may be a new flask full of old wine, and an old flask that has not even new wine in it. (28.) R. Eleazar Hakkappar said, Envy, cupidity and ambition take a man from the world. (29.)He used to say, They that are born are destined to die; and the dead to be brought to life again; and the living to be judged, to know, to make known, and to be made conscious that he is God, he the Maker, he the Creator, he the Discerner, he the Judge, he the Witness, he the Complainant; he it is that will in future judge, blessed be he, with whom there is no unrighteousness, nor forgetfulness, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes: know also that everything is according to the reckoning: and let not thy imagination give thee hope that the grave will be a place of refuge for thee; for perforce thou wast formed, and perforce thou wast born, and thou livest perforce, and perforce thou wilt die, and perforce thou wilt in the future have to give account and reckoning before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he.

Rabbi Chananya, the son of Akashya, said, The Holy One blessed be he, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore he gave them a copious Torah and many commandments, as it is said, It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Torah and make it honorable (Isaiah xlii. 21).

<Chapter> V.

All Israel have a portion in the world to come, as it is said (Isaiah lx. 21), And thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

(1) With ten Sayings{fr. *} the world was created. What does this teach us? Could it not have been created with one Saying? It is to make known the punishment that will befall the wicked who destroy the world that was created with ten Sayings, as well as the goodly reward that will be bestowed upon the just who preserve the world that was created with ten sayings. (2.) There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, to make known how longsuffering God is, seeing that all those generations continued provoking him, until he brought upon them the waters of the flood. (3.) There were ten generations from Noah to Abraham, to make known how longsuffering God is, seeing that all those generations continued provoking him, until Abraham our father came, and received the reward they should all have earned. (4.) With ten trials our father Abraham was tried, and he stood firm in them all, to make known how great was the love of our father Abraham. (5.) Ten miracles were wrought for our fathers in Egypt, and ten at the Sea. (6.) Ten plagues did the Holy One, blessed be he, bring upon the Egyptians in Egypt, and ten at the Sea. (7.) With ten temptations did our fathers tempt the Holy One, blessed be he, in the wilderness, as it is said, And they have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice (Numb. xiv. 22). (8.) Ten miracles were wrought for our fathers in the Temple: no woman miscarried from the scent of the holy flesh; the holy flesh never became putrid; no fly was seen in the slaughter house: no unclean accident ever befell the high priest on the Day of

{cont}Atonement; the rain never quenched the fire of the wood-pile on the altar; neither did the wind overcome the column of smoke that arose therefrom; nor was there ever found any disqualifying defect in the omer (of new barley, offered on the second day of Passover), or in the two loaves (the first fruits of the wheat-harvest, offered on Pentecost), or in the shewbread; though the people stood closely pressed together, they found ample space to prostrate themselves; never did serpent or scorpion injure any one in Jerusalem; nor did any man ever say to his fellow, The place is too strait for me to lodge over night in Jerusalem. (9.) Ten things were created on the eve of Sabbath in the twilight:{fr. *} the mouth of the earth (Numb. xvi. 32); the mouth of the well (Ibid. xxi. 16); the mouth of the ass (Ibid. xxii. 28); the rainbow; the manna; the rod (Exod. iv. 17); the Shamir;{fr. †} the shape of the written characters; the writing, and the tables of stone: some say the destroying spirits also, and the sepulchre of Moses, and the ram of Abraham our father; and others say, tongs also made with tongs{fr. ‡}. (10.) There are seven marks of an uncultured, and seven of a wise man. The wise man does not speak before him who is greater than he in wisdom; and does not break in upon the speech of his fellow; he is not hasty to answer; he questions according to the subject matter, and answers to the point; he speaks upon the first thing first, and upon the last last; regarding that which he has not understood he says, I do not understand it, and he acknowledges the truth. The reverse of all this is to be found in an uncultured man. (11.) Seven kinds of punishment come into the world for seven important transgressions. If some give their tithes and others do not, a dearth ensues from drought, and some suffer hunger while others are full. If they all determine to give no tithes, a dearth ensues from tumult and drought. If they further resolve

not to give the dough-cake (Numb. xv. 20), an exterminating dearth ensues. Pestilence comes into the world to fulfil those death penalties threatened in the Torah, the execution of which, however, is not within the function of a human tribunal, and for the violation of the law regarding the fruits of the seventh year (Levit. xxv. 1–7). The sword comes into the world for the delay of justice, and for the perversion of justice, and on account of the offence of those who interpret the Torah not according to its true sense. Noxious beasts come into the world for vain swearing, and for the profanation of the Divine Name. Captivity comes into the world on account of idolatry, immorality, bloodshed, and the neglect of the year of rest for the soil. (12.) At four periods pestilence grows apace: in the fourth year, in the seventh, at the conclusion of the seventh year, and at the conclusion of the Feast of Tabernacles in each year: in the fourth year, for default of giving the tithe to the poor in the third year (Deut. xiv. 28, 29); in the seventh year, for default of giving the tithe to the poor in the sixth year; at the conclusion of the seventh year, for the violation of the law regarding the fruits of the seventh year, and at the conclusion of the Feast of Tabernacles in each year, for robbing the poor of the grants legally assigned to them.{fr. *} (13.) There are four characters among men: he who says, What is mine is mine and what is thine is thine, his is a neutral character:—some say, this is a character like that of Sodom; he who says, What is mine is thine and what is thine is mine, is a boor; he who says, What is mine is thine and what is thine is thine, is a saint; he who says, What is thine is mine and what is mine is mine, is a wicked man. (14.) There are four kinds of tempers: he whom it is easy to provoke and easy to pacify, his loss disappears in his gain; he whom it is hard to provoke and hard to pacify, his gain disappears in his loss; he whom it is hard to provoke and easy to pacify is a saint; he whom it is easy to provoke and hard to pacify is a wicked man. (15.) There are four qualities in disciples: he who quickly understands and quickly forgets, his gain disappears in his loss; he who understands with difficulty and forgets with difficulty, his loss disappears

{fn. *. The gleanings, the forgotten sheaves, and the corners of the field. See Levit. xix. 9; Deut. xxiv. 19.}

{p. 290}

in his gain; he who understands quickly and forgets with difficulty, his is a good portion; he who understands with difficulty and forgets quickly, his is an evil portion. (16.) As to almsgiving there are four dispositions: he who desires to give, but that others should not give, his eye is evil towards what appertains to others (since almsgiving brings blessing to the giver); he who desires that others should give, but will not give himself, his eye is evil against what is his own; he who gives and wishes others to give is a saint; he who will not give and does not wish others to give is a wicked man. (17.) There are four characters suggested by those who attend the house of study: he who goes and does not practise secures the reward for going; he who practises but does not go secures the reward for practising; he who goes and practises is a saint; he who neither goes nor practises is a wicked man. (18.) There are four qualities among those that sit before the wise: they are like a sponge, a funnel, a strainer, or a sieve: a sponge, which sucks up everything; a funnel, which lets in at one end and out at the other; a strainer, which lets the wine pass out and retains the lees; a sieve, which lets out the bran and retains the fine flour. (19.) Whenever love depends upon some material cause, with the passing away of that cause, the love too passes away; but if it be not dependent upon such a cause, it will not pass away for ever. Which love was that which depended upon a material cause? Such was the love of Amnon and Tamar. And that which depended upon no such cause? Such was the love of David and Jonathan. (20.) Every controversy that is in the Name of Heaven shall in the end lead to a permanent result, but every controversy that is not in the Name of Heaven shall not lead to a permanent result. Which controversy was that which was in the Name of Heaven? Such was the controversy of Hillel and Shammai. And that which was not in the Name of Heaven? Such was the controversy of Korah and all his company. (21.) Whosoever causes the multitude to be righteous, through him no sin shall be brought about: but he who causes the multitude to sin

{p. 291}

shall not have the means to repent (the sins of others being beyond the remedial action of his repentance). Moses was righteous and made the multitude righteous; the righteousness of the multitude was laid upon him, as it is said, He executed the justice of the Lord and his judgments with Israel (Deut. xxxiii. 21). Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, sinned and caused the multitude to sin: the sin of the multitude was laid upon him, as it is said, For the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin (1 Kings xv. 30). (22.) Whosoever has these three attributes is of the disciples of Abraham our father, but whosoever has three other attributes is of the disciples of Balaam the wicked. A good eye, a humble mind and a lowly spirit (are the tokens) of the disciples of Abraham our father; an evil eye, a haughty mind and a proud spirit (are the signs) of the disciples of Balaam the wicked. What is the difference between the disciples of Abraham our father and those of Balaam the wicked? The disciples of Abraham our father enjoy this world and inherit the world to come, as it is said, That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and may fill all their treasuries (Prov. viii. 21); the disciples of Balaam the wicked inherit Gehinnom and descend into the pit of destruction, as it is said, But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee (Psalm lv. 24). (23.) Judah, the son of Tema, said, Be strong as a leopard, light as an eagle, fleet as a hart, and strong as a lion, to do the will of thy Father who is in heaven. He used to say, The bold-faced are for Gehinnom, the shame-faced for the Garden of Eden. (He said further) May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the Temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. (24.) He used to say, At five years the age is reached for the study of the Scripture, at ten for the study of the Mishnah, at thirteen for the

{p. 292}

fulfilment of the commandments, at fifteen for the study of the Talmud, at eighteen for marriage, at twenty for seeking a livelihood, at thirty for entering into one's full strength, at forty for understanding, at fifty for counsel, at sixty a man attains old age, at seventy the hoary head, at eighty the gift of special strength (Psalm xc. 10), at ninety he bends beneath the weight of years, at a hundred he is as if he were already dead and had passed away from the world. (25.) Ben Bag Bag said, Turn it (the Torah) and turn it over again, for everything is in it, and contemplate it, and wax gray and old over it, and stir not from it, for thou canst have no better rule than this. (26.) Ben He He said, According to the labor is the reward.

The sages taught the following in the style of the Mishnah,—Blessed be he that made choice of them and their Mishnah. (1.) R. Meir said. Whosoever labors in the Torah for its own sake merits many things; and not only so, but the whole world is indebted to him: he is called friend, beloved, a lover of the All-present, a lover of mankind: it clothes him

{fn. *. This chapter, called Chapter on the Acquisition of the Torah, or Boraitha of R. Meir, is not a part of the Mishnah, but of the collection of rabbinical dicta next in authority to it, and known as Boraithoth, or "External Teachings."}

in meekness and reverence; it fits him to become just, pious, upright and faithful; it keeps him far from sin, and brings him near to virtue: through him the world enjoys counsel and sound knowledge, understanding and strength, as it is said, Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge; I am understanding; I have strength (Prov. viii. 14{fr. *}): and it gives him sovereignty and dominion and discerning judgment; to him the secrets of the Torah are revealed; he is made like a never-failing fountain, and like a river that flows on with ever-sustained vigor he becomes modest, longsuffering, and forgiving of insults; and it magnifies and exalts him above all things. (2.) R. Joshua, the son of Levi, said, Every day a Bath-kol (a heavenly voice) goes forth from Mount Sinai, proclaiming these words, Woe to mankind for contempt of the Torah, for whoever does not labor in the Torah is said to be under the divine censure, as it is said, As a ring of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman who turneth aside from discretion (Prov. xi. 22); and it says, And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. Read not charuth (graven), but cheruth (freedom), for no man is free but he who labors in the Torah. But whosoever labors in the Torah, behold he shall be exalted, as it is said, And from Mattanah to Nachaliel, and from Nachaliel to Bamoth{fr. ‡} (Numb. xxi. 19). (3.) He who learns from his fellow a single chapter, a single rule, a single verse, a single expression, or even a single letter, ought to pay him honor, for so we find with David, King of Israel, who learnt only two things from Ahitophel,{fr. §} and yet regarded him as his master, His guide and his familiar friend, as it is said, But it was thou, a man, mine equal, my guide, and my familiar friend (Psalm 1v. 14). Now, is it not an argument from minor to major? Ii David, the King of Israel, who learned only two things from Ahitophel, regarded him as his master, guide and familiar

{fn. *. Wisdom, of which the Torah is the embodiment, speaks these words.}

{fn. ‡. A play upon the words of the text: Mattanah = "gift"; Nachaliel = "the heritage of God"; Bamoth = "high places."}

{fn. §. In the two matters referred to in Psalm lv. 15, "We took sweet counsel together," and "We walked into the house of God with the throng," David is said to have followed the teaching of Ahitophel.}

{p. 294}

friend, how much more ought one who learns from his fellow a chapter, rule, verse, expression, or even a single letter, to pay him honor? And honor is nothing but Torah, as it is said, The wise shall inherit honor (Prov. iii. 35); and the perfect shall inherit good (Ibid. xxviii. 10). And good is nothing but Torah, as it is said, For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my Torah (Ibid. iv. 2). (4.) This is the way that is becoming for the study of the Torah: a morsel of bread with salt thou must eat, and water by measure thou must drink, thou must sleep upon the ground, and live a life of trouble the while thou toilest in the Torah. If thou doest this, Happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee (Psalm cxxviii. 2); happy shalt thou be in this world, and it shall be well with thee in the world to come. (5.) Seek not greatness for thyself, and court not honor; let thy works exceed thy learning; and crave not after the table of kings; for thy table is greater than theirs, and thy crown is greater than theirs, and thy Employer is faithful to pay thee the reward of thy work. (6.) The Torah is greater than the priesthood and than royalty, seeing that royalty demands thirty qualifications,{fr. *} the priesthood twenty-four,{fr. †} while the Torah is acquired by forty-eight. And these are they: By audible study; by distinct pronunciation; by understanding and discernment of the heart; by awe, reverence, meekness, cheerfulness; by ministering to the sages, by attaching oneself to colleagues, by discussion with disciples; by sedateness; by knowledge of the Scripture and of the Mishnah; by moderation in business, in intercourse with the world, in pleasure, in sleep, in conversation, in laughter; by longsuffering; by a good heart; by faith in the wise; by resignation

under chastisement; by recognizing one's place, rejoicing in one's portion, putting a fence to one's words, claiming no merit for oneself; by being beloved, loving the All-present, loving mankind, loving just courses, rectitude and reproof; by keeping oneself far from honor, not boasting of one's learning, nor delighting in giving decisions; by bearing the yoke with one's fellow, judging him favorably, and leading him to truth and peace; by being composed in one's study; by asking and answering, hearing and adding thereto (by one's own reflection); by learning with the object of teaching, and by learning with the object of practising; by making one's master wiser, fixing attention upon his discourse, and reporting a thing in the name of him who said it. So thou hast learnt, Whosoever reports a thing in the name of him who said it brings deliverance into the world, as it is said, And Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai (Esther ii. 22). (7.) Great is the Torah which gives life to those that practise it in this world and in the world to come, as it is said, For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh (Prov. iv. 22); and it says, It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones (Ibid. iii. 8); and it says, It is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one is rendered happy (Ibid. iii. 18); and it says, For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck (Ibid. i. 9); and it says, It shall give to thine head a chaplet of grace: a crown of glory it shall deliver to thee (Ibid. iv. 9); and it says, For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased (Ibid. ix. 11); and it says, Length of days is in its right hand; in its left hand are riches and honor (Ibid. iii. 16); and it says, For length of days, and years of life, and peace shall they add to thee (Ibid. iii. 2). (8.) R. Simeon, the son of Judah, in the name of R. Simeon, the son of Jochai, said, Beauty, strength, riches, honor, wisdom, old age and a hoary head and children are comely to the righteous and comely to the world, as it is said, The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found

{p. 296}

in the way of righteousness (Ibid. xvi. 31); and it says, The glory of young men is their strength, and the adornment of old men is the hoary head (Ibid. xx. 29); and it says, A crown unto the wise is their riches (Ibid. xiv. 24); and it says, Children's children are the crown of old men, and the adornment of children are their fathers (Ibid. xvii. 6); and it is said, Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed; for the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his elders shall be glory (Isaiah xxiv. 23). R. Simeon, the son of Menasya, said, These seven qualifications which the sages enumerated as becoming to the righteous were all realized in Rabbi Judah the Prince, and in his sons. (9.) R. José, the son of Kisma, said, I was once walking by the way, when a man met me and saluted me, and I returned the salutation. He said to me, Rabbi, from what place art thou? I said to him, I come from a great city of sages and scribes. He said to me, If thou art willing to dwell with us in our place, I will give thee a thousand thousand golden dinars and precious stones and pearls. I said to him, Wert thou to give me all the silver and gold and precious stones and pearls in the world, I would not dwell anywhere but in a home of the Torah; and thus it is written in the book of Psalms by the hands of David, King of Israel, The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver (Psalm cxix. 72); and not only so, but in the hour of man's departure neither silver nor gold nor precious stones nor pearls accompany him, but only Torah and good works, as it is said, When thou walkest it shall lead thee; when thou liest down it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee (Prov. vi. 22):—when thou walkest it shall lead thee—in this world; when thou liest down it shall watch over thee—in the grave; and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee—in the world to come. And it says, The silver is mine, and the gold is

{p. 297}

mine, saith the Lord of hosts (Haggai ii. 8). (10.) Five pos. sessions the Holy One, blessed be he, made especially his own in his world, and these are they, The Torah, heaven and earth, Abraham, Israel, and the house of the sanctuary. Whence know we this of the Torah? Because it is written, The Lord possessed me as the beginning of his way, before his works, from of old (Prov. viii. 22). Whence of heaven and earth? Because it is written, Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will ye build unto me? and what manner of place for my rest? (Isaiah lxvi. 1); and it says, How manifold are thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy possessions (Psalm civ. 24). Whence of Abraham? Because it is written, And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth (Genesis xiv. 19). Whence of Israel? Because it is written, Till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over which thou hast acquired (Exod. xv. 16); and it says, As for the saints that are in the earth, they are noble ones in whom is all my delight (Psalm xvi. 3). Whence of the house of the sanctuary? Because it is written, The place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have prepared (Exod. xv. 17); and it says, And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain which his right hand had acquired (Psalm lxxviii. 54). (11). Whatsoever the Holy One, blessed be he, created, in his world he created but for his glory, as it is said, Everything that is called by my name, it is for my glory I have created it, I have formed it, yea, I have made it (Isaiah xliii. 7); and it says, The Lord shall reign for ever and ever (Exod. xv. 18).

Rabbi Chananya, the son of Akashya, said, The Holy One, blessed be he, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore he gave them a copious Torah and many commandments, as it is said, It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Torah and make it honorable (Isaiah xlii. 21).

Psalm cxliv.

A Psalm of David. Blessed be the Lord my rock, who teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight: my lovingkindness, and my fortress, my stronghold, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I take refuge: who subdueth my people under me. Lord, what is man, that thou regardest him? or the son of man, that thou takest account of him? Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away. Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. Flash forth lightning, and scatter them: send out thine arrows, and discomfit them. Stretch forth thine hands from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hand of strangers; whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a harp of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword. Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of strangers, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.—When our sons shall be as plants grown tall in their youth, and our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace; when our garners are full, affording all manner of store, and our sheep bring forth by thousands; yea, are multiplied by tens of thousands in our fields; when our oxen are well laden; when there is no breach and no surrender; and no

O let the nations rejoice and exult: for thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, and lead the nations upon the earth. (Selah.) Let the peoples give thanks unto thee, O God; let all the peoples give thanks unto thee. The earth hath yielded her increase: God, even our God, shall bless us.

{cont}He shall cover thee with his pinions, and under his wings shalt thou take refuge: his truth shall be a shield and a buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flieth by day; of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor of the plague that ravageth at noon day. A thousand may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; it shall not come nigh unto thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou look on, and see the retribution of the wicked. For thou, O Lord, art my refuge.—Thou hast made the Most High thy dwelling place; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any scourge come nigh thy tent. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee upon their hands, lest thou strike thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder: upon the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample.—Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name. When he calleth upon me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him and honor him. With length of days will I satisfy him, and will let him see my salvation.

And he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up all his wrath. For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and abounding in lovingkindness to all them that call upon thee. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy Law is truth. Thou wilt show truth to Jacob and lovingkindness to Abraham, according as thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. Blessed be the Lord day by day; if one burdeneth us, God is our salvation. (Selah). The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah.) O Lord of hosts, happy is the man who trusteth in thee. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Blessed is our God, who hath created us for his glory, and hath separated us from them that go astray, and hath given us the Law of truth and planted everlasting life in our midst. May he open our heart unto his Law, and place his love and fear within our hearts, that we

{p. 302}

may do his will and serve him with a perfect heart, that we may not labor in vain, nor bring forth for confusion. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that we may keep thy statutes in this world, and be worthy to live to witness and inherit happiness and blessing in the days of the Messiah and in the life of the world to come. To the end that my glory may sing praise unto thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose trust the Lord is. Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in Jah the Lord is an everlasting rock. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, Lord. It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Law and to make it honorable.

And God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: let peoples serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be every one that blesseth thee. And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples; and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham. From the God of thy father—

{p. 304}

may he help thee,—and the Almighty—may he bless thee with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, blessings of the breasts and the womb. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: may they be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren. And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy corn and thy wine and thine oil, the offspring of thy kine and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness; and he will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. The Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as you are, and bless you, as he hath promised you.

Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the offspring of thy kine, and the young of thy flock. The Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy barns, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasury, the heavens, to give the rain of thy land in its season, and to bless

{p. 305}

all the work of thy hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow. For the Lord thy God will bless thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee. Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, a people saved by the Lora, the shield of thy help, and that is the sword of thy majesty! And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

I have blotted out, as a cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a mist, thy sins; return unto me, for I have redeemed thee. Sing, O ye heavens, for the Lord hath done it; shout, ye nethermost parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, and forest, and every tree therein; for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel. Our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.

Israel is saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded for ever and ever. And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed. And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and there is none else: and my people shall never be ashamed. For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for Jah the Lord is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the peoples, make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is made known in all the earth. Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. And one shall say in that day, Lo, this is our God;

{p. 306}

we have waited for him that he should save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. And abundance of salvation, wisdom and knows. edge shall be the steadfastness of thy times: the fear of the Lord is his treasure. And David prospered in all his ways; and the Lord was with him. He hath rescued my soul in peace so that none might come nigh me, for they were many that were striving with me. And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far be it; as the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan that he died not. And the rescued of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness And the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the Lord thy God loved thee. Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.

He createth the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the Lord, and I will heal him. Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains (and he said), Thine are we, David, and on thy side, O son of Jesse; peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to him that helpeth thee; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them chiefs of the band. And thus ye shall say, All hail, and peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.

Rabbi Jochanan said, In every passage where thou findest

{p. 307}

the greatness of God mentioned, there thou findest also his humility. This is written in the Law, repeated in the Prophets, and a third time stated in the Writings.{fr. *} It is written in the Law, for the Lord your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great, mighty and revered God, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh a bribe. And it is written afterwards, He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. It is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written, For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, and whose name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. It is a third time stated in the Writings, Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol ye him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, anti rejoice before him. And it is written afterwards, A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation. The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us. And ye that cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day. For the Lord hath comforted Zion: he hath comforted all her waste places, and hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody. It pleased the Lord for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Law and to make it honorable.

Psalm cxxviii.

A Song of Degrees. Happy is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways. When thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the recesses of thine house: thy children like olive plants, round about thy

table. Behold thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord. May the Lord bless thee out of Zion: mayest thou see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. Yea, mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.

The Reader says Habdalah, {pr. 310}, omitting the Introductory Verses.

It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else: in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know

{p. 309}

that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law, The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.

The following Kaddish is said by a Mourner.

Mourner.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

Cong. and Mourner.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.

Mourner.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

Cong.—Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore.

Mourner.—May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

THE HABDALAH SERVICE

A cup of wine is taken in the right hand, and the following is said:—

Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for Jah the Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing be upon thy people. (Selah.) The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. (Selah.) The Jews had light and joy and gladness and honor. So be it with us. I will lift the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe who createst the fruit of the vine.

The spice-box is taken, and the following is said:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe who createst divers kinds of spices.

The hands are spread towards the light, and the following is said:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the light of the fire.

The cup is again taken in the right hand, and the following is said:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who makest a distinction between holy and profane, between light and darkness, between Israel

{p. 311}

and other nations, between the seventh day and the six working days. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest a distinction between holy and profane.

$May he who maketh a distinction between holy and profane pardon our sins; our offspring and our possessions may he multiply as the sand, and as the stars in the night.

The day hath declined like the palm tree's shade; I call upon God who performeth all things for me; the watchman saith, The morning cometh, though it now be night.

Thy righteousness is like Mount Tabor: O pass thou wholly over my sins; let them be as yesterday which is past, and as a watch in the night.

The season of mine oblations is over: would that rest again were mine! I am weary with my groaning; in my tears I melt away every night.

Hear my voice, lee it not be cast away; open to me the lofty gate, for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.

Be entreated, O dreaded and awful God; while I cry, grant me thy redemption, in the twilight, in the evening of the day, yea, in the blackness of the night.

I call upon thee, Lord, save thou me; make me to know the path of life; from pining sickness snatch thou me, from day to night.

Cleanse the impurity of my deeds, lest my foes should say, Where is the God that made me, who giveth songs in the night?

We are like clay in thy hand; forgive, we beseech thee, our sins both light and grave, and day shall pour forth the word unto day, and night unto night.

May he who maketh a distinction between holy and profane pardon our sins; our offspring and our possessions may he multiply as the sand, and as the stars in the night./$

MEDITATION AND BLESSINGS ON TAKING THE LULAB.

On Tabernacles, previous to Hallel, {pr. 313}, being said, the Lulab is taken, and the following Meditation and Blessings are read:—

Lo, I am prepared and ready to fulfil the command of my Creator, who hath commanded us in his Law, And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of the tree Hadar, branches of palm trees, a bough of the tree Aboth, and willows of the brook. While I wave them, may the stream of blessings flow in upon me, together with holy thoughts which tell that he is the God of gods and Lord of lords, governing below and above, whose kingdom ruleth over all. May this my observance of the precept of the Four Species be accounted as though I had fulfilled it in all its details and particulars. And let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. Blessed be the Lord for ever, Amen, and Amen.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning the taking of the Lulab.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.

Psalm cxiii.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord. Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof the Lord's name is to be praised. The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God, that dwelleth so high; that looketh down so low upon the heavens and the earth? He raiseth up the lowly out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill; that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. He maketh the barren woman dwell in her house as a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxiv.

When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. The sea saw it, and fled; Jordan turned back. The mountains

{p. 314}

skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams? Ye hills, like lambs? At the presence of the Lord tremble, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

On New Moon and the last Six Days of Passover omit the following paragraph:—

Psalm cxv.

Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy lovingkindness and for the truth's sake. Wherefore should the nations say, Where, then, is their God? But our God is in the heavens, he doeth whatsoever he pleaseth. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not. They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not. As for their hands, they touch not; as for their feet, they walk not; they give no sound through their throat. They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield.

{p. 315}

The Lord hath been mindful of us; he will bless, he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. He will bless them that fear the Lord both small and great. May the Lord increase you, you and your children. Blessed are ye of the Lord, why, made heaven and earth. The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth hath he given to the children of men. The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence; but we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord.

On New Moon and the Iasi Sir Days of Passover omit the following paragraph:—

Psalm cxvi.

I love the Lord, because he heareth my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. The cords of death had encompassed me, and the straits of the grave had come upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then I called upon the name of the Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. Gracious is the Lord and righteous: yea, our God is merciful. The Lord guardeth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, my feet from falling. I shall walk before the Lord in the land of the living. I kept my faith in God ever when I spake, I am greatly afflicted; even when I said in my haste, All men are liars.

{p. 316}

What can I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will lift the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his loving ones. Ah, Lord, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; thou hast loosed my bonds. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people; in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxvii.

O praise the Lord, all ye nations; laud him, all ye peoples. For his lovingkindness is mighty over us; and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise ye the Lord.

The following verses are chanted by the Reader, the Congregation at the end of each verse repeating, "O give thanks," etc., to "ever."

Psalm cxviii.

O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O let Israel say, that his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O let the house of Aaron say, that his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O let them that fear the Lord say, that his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

Out of my straitness I called upon the Lord: the Lord answered me with enlargement. The Lord is for me, I will not fear: what can man do unto me? The Lord is for me among them that help me; therefore shall I see my desire on them that hate me. It is better to trust in the Lord than to confide in man.

{p. 317}

{cont}It is better to trust in the Lord than to confide in princes. All nations compassed me about: in the name of the Lord I surely cut them down. They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: in the name of the Lord I surely cut them down. They compassed me about like bees;—they were extinguished as a fire of thorns:—in the name of the Lord I surely cut them down. Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the Lord helped me. The Lord is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. The voice of exulting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. I shall not die, but live, and recount the works of the Lord. The Lord hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous may enter into it.

I will give thanks unto thee, for thou hast answered me, and art become my salvation.

Repeat this and the next three verses.

O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord our God, and thy pious ones, the just who do thy will, together with all thy people, the house of Israel, shall with exultation thank, bless, praise, glorify, exalt, reverence, sanctify and ascribe sovereignty unto thy name, O our King; for it is good to give thanks unto thee, and becoming to sing praises unto thy name, because from everlasting to everlasting thou art God. Blessed art thou, O Lord, a King extolled with praises.

Thou causest the wind to blow and the rain to fall.

Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth?

Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead.{fr. *}

* Reader.—We will sanctify thy name in the world even as they sanctify it in the highest heavens, as it is written by the hand of thy prophet:

Reader.—Those over against them say, Blessed—

Cong.—Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.

Cong.—The Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

The beginnings of the months thou didst assign unto thy people for a season of atonement throughout their generations. While they offered unto thee acceptable sacrifices, and goats for a sin offering to atone for them, these were to be a memorial for them all, and the salvation of their soul from the hand of the enemy. O do thou establish a new altar on Zion, and

{p. 321}

we will offer upon it the burnt offering of the New Moon, and prepare he-goats for thine acceptance; while we all of us rejoice in the service of the sanctuary, and in the songs of David thy servant, Which shall then be heard in thy city and chanted before thine altar. O vouchsafe unto them everlasting love, and the covenant of the fathers remember unto the children. Bring us with exultation to Zion thy city, and to Jerusalem thy sanctuary with everlasting joy, and there will we prepare unto thee the offerings that are obligatory for us, the continual offerings according to their order, and the additional offerings according to their enactment; and the additional offering of this New Moon we will prepare and offer unto thee in love according to the precept of thy will, as thou hast prescribed for us in thy Law through the hand of Moses thy servant, by the mouth of thy glory, as it is said:

And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord; two young bullocks and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish. And their meal offering and their drink offerings as hath been ordained, three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for each bullock, two tenth parts for the ram, one tenth for each lamb, and wine according to the drink offering of each, a goat for atonement, and two daily offerings according to their institution.

Our God and God of our fathers, renew this month unto us for good and for blessing, for joy and gladness, for salvation and consolation, for support and sustenance,

{p. 322}

for life and peace, for pardon of sin and forgiveness of iniquity, (in Leap Year add, and for atonement of transgression); for thou hast chosen thy people Israel from all nations, and hast appointed unto them statutes for the beginnings of the months. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest Israel and the beginnings of the months.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

And let our eyes behold thy return in mercy to Zion. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest thy divine presence unto Zion.

We give thanks unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God and the God of our fathers for ever and ever; thou art the Rock of our lives, the Shield of our salvation through every generation. We will give thanks unto thee and declare thy praise for our lives which are committed unto thy hand, and for our souls

In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee.

The following Amidah is said at the Evening, Morning and Afternoon Services.

O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses and possessest all things; who rememberest the pious deeds of the patriarchs, and in love wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.

Remember us unto life, O King, who delightest in life, and inscribe us in the book of life, for thine own sake, O living God.

O King, Helper, Savior and Shield. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the Shield of Abraham.

Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art mighty to save.

Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness. quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like

{p. 350}

unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth?

Who is like unto thee, Father of mercy, who in mercy rememberest thy creatures unto life?

Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead.

Thou art holy, and thy name is holy, and holy beings praise thee daily. (Selah.)

Now, therefore, O Lord our God, impose thine awe upon all thy works, and thy dread upon all that thou hast created, that all works may fear thee and all creatures prostrate themselves before thee, that they may all form a single band to do thy will with a perfect heart, even as we know, O Lord our God, that dominion is thine, strength is in thy hand, and might in thy right hand, and that thy name is to be feared above all that thou hast created.

Give then glory, O Lord, unto thy people, praise to them that fear thee, hope to them that seek thee, and free speech to them that wait for thee, joy to thy land, gladness to thy city, a flourishing horn unto David thy servant, and a clear shining light unto the son of Jesse, thine anointed, speedily in our days.

{p. 351}

Then shall the just also see and be glad, and the upright shall exult, and the pious triumphantly rejoice, while iniquity shall close her mouth, and all wickedness shall be wholly consumed like smoke, when thou makest the dominion of arrogance to pass away from the earth.

And thou, O Lord, shalt reign, thou alone over all thy works on Mount Zion, the dwelling place of thy glory, and in Jerusalem, thy holy city, as it is written in thy Holy Words, The Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion; unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

Holy art thou, and dreaded is thy name, and there is no God beside thee, as it is written, And the Lord of hosts is exalted in judgment, and the holy God is sanctified in righteousness. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy King.

Thou hast chosen us from all peoples, thou hast loved us and taken pleasure in us, and hast exalted us above all tongues; thou hast sanctified us by thy commandments and brought us near unto thy service, O our King, and called us by thy great and holy name.

On Saturday Night add the following:—

Thou, O Lord our God, hast made known unto us the judgments of thy righteousness; thou hast taught us to perform the statutes of thy will; thou hast given us, O Lord our God, righteous judgments, true laws, good statutes and commandments. Thou hast also caused us to inherit seasons of joy, appointed times

{p. 352}

of holiness, and feasts of free will gifts, and hast given us as an heritage the holiness of the Sabbath, the glory of the appointed time, and the celebration of the festival. Thou hast made a distinction, O Lord our God, between holy and profane, between light and darkness, between Israel and other nations, between the seventh day and the six working days; thou hast made a distinction between the holiness of the Sabbath and that of the festival, and hast hallowed the seventh day above the six working days; thou hast distinguished and sanctified thy people Israel by thy holiness.

And thou hast given us in love, O Lord our God [this Sabbath Day and] this Day of Memorial, a day of blowing the Shofar, [on Sabbath substitute for the last phrase—a day of remembrance of blowing the Shofar, in love]; an holy convocation as a memorial of the departure from Egypt.

Our God and God of our fathers! May our remembrance rise and come and be accepted before thee, with the remembrance of our fathers, of Messiah the son of David thy servant, of Jerusalem thy holy city, and of all thy people the house of Israel, bringing deliverance and well-being, grace, lovingkindness and mercy, life and peace on this Day of Memorial. Remember us, O Lord our God, thereon for our wellbeing; be mindful of us for blessing, and save us unto life: by thy promise of salvation and mercy, spare us and be gracious unto us; have mercy upon us and save us; for our eyes are bent upon thee, because thou art a gracious and merciful God and King.

{p. 353}

Our God and God of our fathers, reign thou in thy glory over the whole universe, and be exalted above all the earth in thine honor, and shine forth in the splendor and excellence of thy might upon all the inhabitants of thy world, that whatsoever hath been made may know that thou hast made it, and whatsoever hath been created may understand that thou hast created it, and whatsoever hath breath in its nostrils may say, The Lord God of Israel is King, and his dominion ruleth over all. [Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest.] Sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness,. and gladden us with thy salvation [and in thy love and favor, O Lord our God, let us inherit thy holy Sabbath; and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rest thereon.] O purify our hearts to serve thee in truth, for thou art God in truth and thy word is truth, and endureth for ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, King over all the earth, who sanctifiest [the Sabbath and] Israel and the Day of Memorial.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

[They that keep the Sabbath and call it a delight shall rejoice in thy kingdom; the people that hallow the seventh day, even all of them, shall be satiated and delighted with thy goodness, seeing that thou didst find pleasure in the seventh day, and didst hallow it; thou didst call it the desirable of days, in remembrance of the creation.]

It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude.

We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law, The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

And it is said, He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the trumpet shout of a King is among them. And it is said, And he became King in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, the tribes of Israel together. And in thy Holy Words it is written, saying, For the kingdom is the Lord's, and he is ruler over the nations. And it is said, The Lord reigneth; he hath robed him in majesty; the Lord hath robed him, yea, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is set firm, that it cannot be

{p. 365}

moved. And it is said, Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. (Selah.) And by the hands of thy servants, the prophets, it is written, saying, Thus saith the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. And it is said, And saviors shall come up on Mount Zion to judge the Mount of Esau, and the kingdom shall be the Lord's. And it is said, And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One and his name One. And in thy Law it is written saying, Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

Our God and God of our fathers, reign thou in thy glory over the whole universe, and be exalted above all the earth in thine honor, and shine forth in the splendor and excellence of thy might upon all the inhabitants of thy world, that whatsoever hath been made may know that thou hast made it, and whatsoever hath been created may understand that thou hast created it, and whatsoever hath breath in its nostrils may say, the Lord God of Israel is King and his dominion ruleth over all. [Our God and

{p. 366}

{cont}God of our fathers, accept our rest.] Sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness, and gladden us with thy salvation: [and in thy love and favor, O Lord our God, let us inherit thy holy Sabbath; and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rest thereon]. O purify our hearts to serve thee in truth, for thou art God in truth, and thy word is truth, and endureth for ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord,) King over all the earth, who sanctifiest [the Sabbath and] Israel and the Day of Memorial.

Thou rememberest what was wrought from eternity and art mindful of all that hath been formed from of old: before thee all secrets are revealed and the multitude of hidden things from the beginning; for there is no forgetfulness before the throne of thy glory; nor is there ought hidden from thine eves. Thou rememberest every deed that hath been done: not a creature is concealed from thee: all things are manifest and known unto thee, O Lord our God, who lookest and seest to the end of all generations. For thou wilt bring on the appointed time of memorial when every spirit and soul shall be visited, and the multitudinous works be remembered with the innumerable throng of thy creatures. >From the beginning thou didst make this thy purpose known, and from aforetime thou didst disclose it. This day, on which was the beginning of thy work, is a memorial of the first day, for it is a statute for Israel, a decree of the God of Jacob. Thereon also sentence is pronounced upon countries,—which of them is destined to the

{p. 367}

sword and which to peace, which to famine and Which to plenty; and each separate creature is visited thereon, and recorded for life or for death. Who is not visited on this day? For the remembrance of every creature cometh before thee, each man's deeds and destiny, his works and ways, his thoughts and schemes, his imaginings and achievements. Happy is the man who forgetteth thee not, and the son of man who strengtheneth himself in thee; for they that seek thee shall never stumble, neither shall any be put to shame who trust in thee. Yea, the remembrance of all works cometh before thee, and thou enquirest into the doings of them all. Of Noah also thou wast mindful in thy love, and didst visit him with a promise of salvation and mercy, when thou broughtest the waters of the flood to destroy all flesh on account of their evil deeds. So his remembrance came before thee, O Lord our God, to increase his seed like the dust of the earth, and his offspring like the sand of the sea: as it is written in thy Law, And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided. And it is said, And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. And it is said, Then will I remember my covenant with

{p. 368}

{cont}Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. And in thy Holy Words it is written saying, He hath made a memorial for his wondrous works: the Lord is gracious and full of compassion. And it is said, He hath given food unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. And it is said, And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. And by the hands of thy servants, the prophets, it is written saying, Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy bridal state; how thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. And it is said, Nevertheless, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. And it is said, Is Ephraim a precious son unto me? Is he a caressed child? As often as I spake against him, I earnestly remembered him . therefore my heart yearneth for him: I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.

Our God and God of our fathers, let us be remembered by thee for good: grant us a visitation of salvation and mercy from thy heavens, the heavens of old; and remember unto us, O Lord our God, the covenant and the lovingkindness and the oath which thou swarest unto Abraham our father on Mount Moriah: and may the binding with which Abraham our father bound his son Isaac on the altar appear before thee.

{p. 369}

how he overbore his compassion in order to perform thy will with a perfect heart. So may thy compassion overbear thine anger against us; in thy great goodness may the fierceness of thy wrath turn aside from thy people, thy city and thine inheritance. Fulfil unto us, O Lord our God, the word in which thou hast bidden us trust in thy Law through the hand of Moses thy servant, from the mouth of thy glory, as it is said, But I will remember unto them the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the Lord. For thou art he who remembereth from eternity all forgotten things, and before the throne of whose glory there is no forgetfulness. O remember the binding of Isaac this day in mercy unto his seed. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who rememberest the covenant.

Thou didst reveal thyself in a cloud of glory unto thy holy people in order to speak with them. Out of heaven thou didst make them hear thy voice and wast revealed unto them in clouds of purity. The whole world trembled at thy presence, and the works of creation were in awe of thee, when thou didst thus reveal thyself, O our King, upon Mount Sinai to teach thy people the law and commandments, and didst make them hear thy majestic voice and thy holy utterances out of flames of fire. Amidst thunders and lightnings thou didst manifest thyself to them, and while the Shofar sounded thou didst shine forth upon them; as it is written in thy Law, And it came to pass on the

{p. 370}

third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the sound of the Shofar exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled. And it is said, And the sound of the Shofar waxed louder and louder; Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. And it is said, And all the people perceived the thunderings and the lightnings, and the sound of the Shofar, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they were moved and stood afar off. And in thy Holy Words it is written, saying, God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a Shofar. And it is said, With trumpets and sound of Shofar shout joyously before the King, the Lord. And it is said, Blow the Shofar on the new moon, at the beginning of the month, for our day of festival; for it is a statute for Israel, a decree of the God of Jacob. And it is said, Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his abundant greatness. Praise him with the blast of the Shofar: praise him with the harp and the lyre. Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and the pipe, Praise him with the clear-toned cymbals: praise him with the loud-sounding cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. And by the hands of thy servants, the prophets, it is written saying, All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye, and when the Shofar is

{p. 371}

blown, hear ye. And it is said, And it shall come to pass on that day, that a great Shofar shall be blown; and they shall come who were lost in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship the Lord in the holy mountain at Jerusalem. And it is said, And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blow the Shofar, and shall go with the whirlwinds of the south. The Lord of hosts shall be a shield unto them. So be a shield unto thy people Israel with thy peace.

Our God and God of our fathers, sound the great Shofar for our freedom, lift up the ensign to gather our exiles; bring our scattered ones among the nations near unto thee, and gather our dispersed from the ends of the earth. Lead us with exultation unto Zion, thy city, and unto Jerusalem the place of thy sanctuary with everlasting joy; and there we will prepare before thee the offerings that are obligatory for us, as is commanded us in thy Law through the hand of Moses thy servant, from the mouth of thy glory, as it is said, And in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the Lord your God. For thou hearest the sound of the Shofar and givest heed to the trumpet-blast, and there

{p. 372}

is none like unto thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who in mercy hearest the sound of the trumpet-blast of thy people Israel.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

And let our eyes behold thy return in mercy to Zion. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest thy divine presence unto Zion.

We give thanks unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God and the God of our fathers for ever and ever; thou art the Rock of our lives, the Shield of our salvation through every generation. We will give thanks unto thee and declare thy praise for our lives which are committed unto thy hand, and for our souls which are in thy charge, and for thy miracles, which are daily with us, and for thy

At the repetition of the Amidah by the Reader, the following is introduced:—

Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the three-fold blessing of thy Law written by the hand of Moses thy servant, which was spoken by Aaron and his sons, the priests, thy holy people, as it is said, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.

Grant peace, welfare, blessing, grace, lovingkindness and mercy unto us and unto all Israel, thy people. Bless us, O our Father, even all of us together, with the light of thy countenance; for by the light of thy countenance thou hast given us, O Lord our God,

the Law of life, lovingkindness and righteousness, blessing, mercy, life and peace; and may it be good it thy sight to bless thy people Israel at all times and in every hour with thy peace.

In the book of life, blessing, peace and good sustenance may we be remembered and inscribed before thee, we and all thy people the house of Israel, for a happy life and for peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord who makest peace.

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

On the {sic "Frst" "First"} Day of New Year, or, when New Year falls on Sabbath, on the Second Day, after the Afternoon Service, it is customary to go to the banks of a river, or of any other piece of water, and to say the following:—

Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness. He will turn again and have mercy upon us; he will subdue our iniquities. And thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. O mayest thou cast all the sins of thy people, the house of Israel, into a place where they shall be no more remembered or visited, or ever

again come to mind. Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, and lovingkindness to Abraham as thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.

On the day previous to the Fast of Atonement, Afternoon Service is said as on Fridays, but earlier than usual, After "who makest peace," {pr. 65}, say "Our God . . . let our prayer come," to the end of the Amidah for the Day of Atonement; see pp. {prr. 383}–{prr. 389}.

SERVICE FOR THE DAY OF ATONEMENT

O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses, and possessest all things, who rememberest the pious deeds of the patriarchs, and in love wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.

Remember us unto life, O King, who delightest in life, and inscribe us in the book of life, for thine own sake, O living God.

O King, Helper, Savior and Shield. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the Shield of Abraham.

Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art mighty to save.

Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth?

{p. 378}

Who is like unto thee, Father of mercy, who in mercy rememberest thy creatures unto life?

Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead.

Thou art holy, and thy name is holy, and holy beings praise thee daily. (Selah.)

Now, therefore, O Lord our God, impose thine awe upon all thy works, and thy dread upon all that thou hast created, that all works may fear thee and all creatures prostrate themselves before thee, that they may all form a single band to do thy will with a perfect heart, even as we know, O Lord our God, that dominion is thine, strength is in thy hand, and might in thy right hand, and that thy name is to be feared above all that thou hast created.

Give then glory, O Lord, unto thy people, praise to them that fear thee, hope to them that seek thee, and free speech to them that wait for thee, joy to thy land, gladness to thy city, a flourishing horn unto David thy servant, and a clear shining light unto the son of Jesse, thine anointed, speedily in our days.

Then shall the just also see and be glad, and the upright shall exult, and the pious triumphantly rejoice, while iniquity shall close her mouth, and all

{p. 379}

wickedness shall be wholly consumed like smoke, when thou makest the dominion of arrogance to pass away from the earth.

And thou, O Lord, shalt reign, thou alone over all thy works on Mount Zion, the dwelling place of thy glory, and in Jerusalem, thy holy city, as it is written in thy Holy Words, The Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

Holy art thou, and dreaded is thy name, and there is no God beside thee, as it is written, And the Lord of hosts is exalted in judgment, and the holy God is sanctified in righteousness. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy King.

Thou hast chosen us from all peoples, thou hast loved us and taken pleasure in us, and hast exalted us above all tongues; thou hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and brought us near unto thy service, O our King, and hast called us by thy great and holy name.

On Sabbath add the words in brackets.

And thou hast given us in love, O Lord our God, [this Sabbath day for holiness and rest, and] this Day of Atonement for pardon, forgiveness, and atonement, that we may [in love] obtain pardon thereon for all our iniquities; an holy convocation, as a memorial of the departure from Egypt.

{p. 380}

Our God and God of our fathers! May our remembrance rise and come and be accepted before thee, with the remembrance of our fathers, of Messiah, the son of David thy servant, of Jerusalem thy holy city, and of all thy people the house of Israel, bringing deliverance and well-being, grace, lovingkindness and mercy, life and peace on this Day of Atonement. Remember us, O Lord our God, thereon for our wellbeing; be mindful of us for blessing, and save us unto life; by thy promise of salvation and mercy, spare us and be gracious unto us; have mercy upon us and save us; for our eyes are bent upon thee, because thou art a gracious and merciful God and King.

Our God and God of our fathers, pardon our iniquities [on this Sabbath day, and] on this Day of Atonement; blot out our transgressions and our sins, and make them pass away from before thine eyes; as it is said, I even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins. And it is said, I have blotted out, as a cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a mist, thy sins: return unto me, for I have redeemed thee. And it is said, For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the Lord. [Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest.] Sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant

{p. 381}

our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness, and gladden us with thy salvation; [and let us inherit, O Lord our God, in love and favor, thy holy Sabbath; and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rejoice thereon]; and purify our hearts to serve thee in truth; for thou art the forgiver of Israel and the pardoner of the tribes of Jeshurun in every generation, and beside thee we have no king who pardoneth and forgiveth. Blessed art thou, O Lord, thou King, who pardonest and forgivest our iniquities and the iniquities of thy people, the house of Israel, who makest our trespasses to pass away year by year, King over all the earth, who sanctifiest [the Sabbath and] Israel and the day of Atonement.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

And let our eyes behold thy return in mercy to Zion. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest thy divine presence unto Zion.

Our God and God of our fathers,

let our prayer come before thee; hide not thyself from our supplication, for we are not arrogant and stiff-necked, that we should say before thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned; but verily, we have sinned.

{p. 384}

We have trespassed, we have been faithless, we have robbed, we have spoken basely, we have committed iniquity, we have wrought unrighteousness, we have been presumptuous, we have done violence, we have forged lies, we have counselled evil, we have spoken falsely, we have scoffed, we have revolted, we have blasphemed, we have been rebellious, we have acted perversely, we have transgressed, we have persecuted, we have been stiff-necked, we have done wickedly, we have corrupted ourselves, we have committed abomination, we have gone astray, and we have led astray.

We have turned aside from thy commandments and good judgments, and it hath profited us nought. But thou art righteous in all that is come upon us; for thou hast acted truthfully, but we have wrought unrighteousness.

What shall we say before thee, O thou who dwellest on high, and what shall we recount unto thee, thou who abidest in the heavens? dost thou not know all things, both the hidden and the revealed?

Thou knowest the secrets of eternity and the most hidden mysteries of all living. Thou searchest the innermost recesses, and triest the reins and the heart. Nought is concealed from thee, or hidden from thine eyes.

May it then be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to forgive us for all our sins, to pardon us for all our iniquities, and to grant us remission for all our transgressions.

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law, In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

ADDITIONAL SERVICE FOR THE DAY OF ATONEMENT

O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses and possessest all things; who rememberest the pious deeds of the patriarchs, and in love wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.

Remember us unto life, O King, who delightest in life, and inscribe us in the book of life, for thine own sake, O living God.

O King, Helper, Savior and Shield. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the Shield of Abraham.

Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art mighty to save.

Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with greet mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth?

Who is like unto thee, Father of mercy, who in mercy rememberest thy creatures unto life?

{p. 391}

Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead.

Thou art holy, and thy name is holy, and holy being. praise thee daily. (Selah.)

Now, therefore, O Lord our God, impose thine awe upon all thy works, and thy dread upon all that thou hast created, that all works may fear thee and all creatures prostrate themselves before thee, that they may all form a single band to do thy will with a perfect heart, even as we know, O Lord our God, that dominion is thine, strength is in thy hand, and might in thy right hand, and that thy name is to be feared above all that thou hast created.

Give then glory, O Lord, unto thy people, praise to them that fear thee, hope to them that seek thee, and free speech to them that wait for thee, joy to thy land, gladness to thy city, a flourishing horn unto David thy servant, and a clear shining light unto the son of Jesse, thine anointed, speedily in our days.

Then shall the just also see and be glad, and the upright shall exult, and the pious triumphantly rejoice, while iniquity shall close her mouth, and all wickedness shall be wholly consumed like smoke, when thou makest the dominion of arrogance to pass away from the earth.

{p. 392}

And thou, O Lord, shalt reign, thou alone over all thy works on Mount Zion, the dwelling place of thy glory, and in Jerusalem, thy holy city, as it is written in thy Holy Words, The Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

Holy art thou, and dreaded is thy name, and there is no God beside thee, as it is written, And the Lord of hosts is exalted in judgment, and the holy God is sanctified in righteousness. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy King.

Thou hast chosen us from all peoples, thou hast loved us and taken pleasure in us, and hast exalted us above all tongues; thou hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast brought us near unto thy service, O our King, and hast called us by thy great and holy name.

On Sabbath add the words in brackets.

And thou, hast given us in love, O Lord our God, [this Sabbath day for holiness and rest, and] this Day of Atonement for pardon, forgiveness and atonement, that we may [in love] obtain pardon thereon for all our iniquities; an holy convocation, as a memorial of the departure from Egypt.

But on account of our sins we were exiled from our land, and removed far from our country, and we are unable to fulfil our obligations in thy chosen house, that great and holy temple which was called by thy

{p. 393}

name because of the hand that hath been stretched out against thy sanctuary. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, merciful King, that thou mayest again in thine abundant compassion have mercy upon us and upon thy sanctuary, and mayest speedily rebuild it and magnify its glory. Our Father, our King, do thou speedily make the glory of thy kingdom manifest upon us; shine forth and exalt thyself upon us in the sight of all living; bring our scattered ones among the nations near unto thee, and gather our dispersed from the ends of the earth. Lead us with exultation unto Zion thy city, and unto Jerusalem the place of thy sanctuary, with everlasting joy; and there we will prepare before thee the offerings that are obligatory for us, the continual offerings according to their order, and the additional offerings according to their enactment: and the additional offerings of [this Sabbath day and] this day of Atonement we will prepare and offer unto thee in love according to the precept of thy will, as thou hast prescribed for us in thy Law through the hand of Moses thy servant, by the mouth of thy glory, as it is said:—

[And on the Sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two-tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof; this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering and the drink offering thereof.]

And on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall

{p. 394}

afflict your souls, ye shall do no manner of work. And ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord for a sweet savor; one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish. And their meal offering and their drink offerings as hath been ordained; three-tenth parts of an ephah for each bullock, and two-tenth parts for the ram, and one-tenth part for each lamb, with wine according to the drink offering thereof, and two he-goats wherewith to make atonement, and the two continual offerings according to their enactment.

[They that keep the Sabbath and call it a delight shall rejoice in thy kingdom; the people that hallow the seventh day, even all of them shall be satiated and delighted with thy goodness, seeing that thou didst find pleasure in the seventh day and didst hallow it; thou didst call it the desirable of days, in remembrance of the creation.]

Our God and God of our fathers, pardon our iniquities [on this Sabbath day, and] on this Day of Atonement; blot out our transgressions and our sins, and make them pass away from before thine eyes; as it is said, I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins. And it is said, I have blotted out, as a cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a mist, thy sins: return unto me, for I have redeemed thee. And it is said, For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the Lord. [Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest.] Sanctify us by thy commandments, and grant

{p. 395}

our portion in thy Law; satisfy us with thy goodness and gladden us with thy salvation; [and let us inherit, O Lord our God, in love and favor, thy holy Sabbath and may Israel, who hallow thy name, rejoice thereon] and purify our hearts to serve thee in truth; for thou art the forgiver of Israel and the pardoner of the tribes of Jeshurun in every generation, and beside thee We have no king who pardoneth and forgiveth. Blessed art thou, O Lord, thou King who pardonest and forgivest our iniquities and the iniquities of thy people, the house of Israel, who makest our trespasses to pass away year by year, King over all the earth, who sanctifiest [the Sabbath and] Israel and the day of Atonement.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the fire offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

And let our eyes behold thy return in mercy to Zion. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest thy divine presence unto Zion.

We give thanks unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God and the God of our fathers for ever and ever; thou art the Rock of

We will give thanks unto thee and declare thy praise for our lives which are committed unto thy hand, and for our souls which are in thy charge, and for thy miracles, which are daily with us, and for thy wonders and thy benefits, which are wrought at all times, evening, morn and noon. O thou who art all-good, whose mercies fail not; thou, merciful Being, whose lovingkindnesses never cease, we have ever hoped in thee.

For all these things thy name, O our King, shall be continually blessed and exalted for ever and ever.

O inscribe all the children of thy covenant for a happy life.

And everything that liveth shall give thanks unto thee for ever, and shall praise thy name in truth, O God, our salvation and our help. Blessed art thou, O Lord, whose name is All-good, and unto whom it is becoming to give thanks.

At the repetition of the Amidah by the Reader, the following is introduced:—

Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the

{p. 397}

three-fold blessing of thy Law written by the hand of Moses thy servant, which was spoken by Aaron and his sons, the priests, thy holy people, as it is said, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.

Grant peace, welfare, blessing, grace, lovingkindness and mercy unto us and unto all Israel, thy people. Bless us, O our Father, even all of us together, with the light of thy countenance; for by the light of thy countenance thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the Law of life, lovingkindness and righteousness, blessing, mercy, life and peace; and may it be good in thy sight to bless thy people Israel at all times and in every hour with thy peace.

In the book of life, blessing, peace and good sustenance may we be remembered and inscribed before thee, we and all thy people the house of Israel, for a happy life and for peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest peace.

Our God and God of our fathers,

Let our prayer come before thee; hide not thyself from our supplication, for we are not arrogant and stiff-necked, that we should say before thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned; but verily, we have sinned

{p. 398}

We have trespassed, we have been faithless, we have robbed, we have spoken basely, we have committed iniquity, we have wrought unrighteousness, we have been presumptuous, we have done violence, we have forged lies, we have counselled evil, we have spoken falsely, we have scoffed, we have revolted, we have blasphemed, we have been rebellious, we have acted perversely, we have transgressed, we have persecuted we have been stiff-necked, we have done wickedly, we have corrupted ourselves, we have committed abomination, we have gone astray, and we have led astray.

We have turned aside from thy commandments and good judgments, and it hath profited us nought. But thou art righteous in all that is come upon us; for thou hast acted truthfully, but we have wrought unrighteousness.

What shall we say before thee, O thou who dwellest on high, and what shall we recount unto thee, thou who abidest in the heavens? dost thou not know all things, both the hidden and the revealed?

Thou knowest the secrets of eternity and the most hidden mysteries of all living. Thou searchest the innermost recesses, and triest the reins and the heart. Nought is concealed from thee, or hidden from thine eyes.

May it then be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to forgive us for all our sins, to pardon us for all our iniquities, and to grant us remission for all our transgressions.

three-fold blessing of thy Law written by the hand of Moses thy servant, which was spoken by Aaron and his sons, the priests, thy holy people, as it is said, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.

Grant peace, welfare, blessing, grace, lovingkindness and mercy unto us and unto all Israel, thy people. Bless us, O our Father, even all of us together, with the light of thy countenance; for by the light of thy countenance thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the Law of life, lovingkindness and righteousness, blessing, mercy, life and peace; and may it be good in thy sight to bless thy people Israel at all times and in every hour with thy peace.

In the book of life, blessing, peace and good sustenance may we be remembered and sealed before thee, we and all thy people the house of Israel, for a happy life and for peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest peace.

Our God and God of our fathers

Let our prayer come before thee; hide not thyself from our supplication, for we are not arrogant and stiff-necked, that we should say before thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, we are righteous and have not sinned; but verily, we have sinned.

{p. 411}

We have trespassed, we have been faithless, we have robbed, we have spoken basely, we have committed iniquity, we have wrought unrighteousness, we have been presumptuous, we have done violence, we have forged lies, we have counselled evil, we have spoken falsely, we have scoffed, we have revolted, we have blasphemed, we have been rebellious, we have acted perversely, we have transgressed, we have persecuted, we have been stiff-necked, we have done wickedly, we have corrupted ourselves, we have committed abomination, we have gone astray, and we have led astray.

We have turned aside from thy commandments and good judgments, and it hath profited us nought. But thou art righteous in all that is come upon us; for thou hast acted truthfully, but we have wrought unrighteousness.

What shall we say before thee, O thou who dwellest on high, and what shall we recount unto thee, thou who abidest in the heavens? dost thou not know all things, both the hidden and the revealed?

Thou givest a hand to transgressors, and thy right hand is stretched out to receive the penitent; thou hast taught us, O Lord our God, to make confession unto thee of all our sins, in order that we may cease from the violence of our hands, that thou mayest receive us into thy presence in perfect repentance, even as fire offerings and sweet savors, for thy words’ sake which thou hast spoken. Endless would be the fire offerings required for our guilt, and numberless the sweet savors for our trespasses; but thou knowest that our latter end is the worm, and hast therefore multiplied the

{p. 412}

means of our forgiveness. What are we? What is our life? What is our piety? What our righteousness; What our helpfulness? What our strength? What our might? What shall we say before thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nought before thee, the men of renown as though they had not been, the wise as if without knowledge, and the men of understanding as if with. out discernment? For most of their works are void, and the days of their lives are vanity before thee, and the pre-eminence of man over the beast is nought, for all is vanity.

Thou hast distinguished man from the beginning, and hast recognized his privilege that he might stand before thee; far who shall say unto thee, What doest thou? and if he be righteous what can he give thee? But thou of thy love hast given us, O Lord our God [this Sabbath day and] this Day of Atonement to be the end of, as well as the season of pardon and forgiveness for, all our iniquities, that we may cease from the violence of our hands, and may return unto thee to do the statutes of thy will with a perfect heart. O do thou, in thy abounding compassion, have mercy upon us, for thou delightest not in the destruction of the world, as it is said, Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. And it is said, Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God for he will abundantly pardon. But thou art a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow

{p. 413}

to anger, plenteous in lovingkindness, and abounding in goodness; thou delightest in the repentance of the wicked, and hast no pleasure in their death; as it is said, Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? And it is said, Have I at all any pleasure in the death of the wicked, saith the Lord God, and not rather that he should return from his way, and live? And it is said, For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God; wherefore turn yourselves and live. For thou art the pardoner of Israel and the forgiver of the tribes of Jeshurun in every generation, and beside thee we have no King who pardoneth and forgiveth.

O my God, before I was formed I was nothing worth, and now that I have been formed I am but as though I had not been formed. Dust am I in my life: how much more so in my death. Behold I am before thee like a vessel filled with shame and confusion. O may it be thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, that I may sin no more, and as to the sins I have committed, purge them away in thine abounding compassion though not by means of affliction and sore diseases.

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust.

{p. 414}

{cont}Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

SERVICE FOR CHANUKAH

The Feast of Dedication lasts eight days. On the first evening a light is kindled, the number of lights being increased by one on each consecutive evening. The Chanukah lights should be kindled as soon as possible after nightfall.

On Friday the lights are kindled before the beginning of the Sabbath.

Before kindling the lights the following Blessings are said:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and commanded us to kindle the light of Chanukah.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who wroughtest miracles for our fathers in days of old, at this season.

The following Blessing is said on the first evening only:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.

After kindling the first light, the following is said:—

We kindle these lights on account of the miracles, the deliverances and the wonders which thou didst work for our fathers, by means of thy holy priests. During all the eight days of Chanukah these lights are sacred, neither is it permitted us to make any profane use of them; but we are only to look at them, in order that we may give thanks unto thy name for thy miracles, thy deliverances and thy wonders.

In the Synagogue Psalm xxx., {pr. 103} is chanted.

{p. 421}

In the home the following Hymn is chanted.

O Fortress, Rock of my salvation, unto thee it is becoming to give praise: let my house of prayer be restored, and I will there offer thee thanksgivings when thou shalt have prepared a slaughter of the blaspheming foe, I will complete with song and psalm the dedication of the altar.

Full sated was my soul with ills, my strength was spent with sorrow; they embittered my life by hardship during my subjection to the dominion of Egypt,{fr. *} but God with his great power brought forth the chosen race, while the host of Pharaoh and all his seed sank like a stone into the deep.

To his holy oracle he brought me, yet there also I found no peace, for the oppressor came and led me captive, because I had served strange gods: I had to quaff the wine of bewilderment; well nigh had I perished, when Babylon's end drew near; through Zerubbabel I was saved after seventy years.

The Agagite (Haman), the son of Hammedatha, sought to cut down the lofty fir tree (Mordecai){fr. †}; but his design became a snare to himself, and his pride was brought to an end. The head of the Benjamite thou didst exalt, but the enemy's name thou Midst blot out: the many sons he had gotten thou didst hang upon the gallows.

The Grecians were gathered against me in the days of the Hasmoneans; they broke down the walls of my towers, and defiled all the oils; but from one of the last remaining flasks a miracle was wrought for thy beloved{fr. ‡}, and their men of understanding appointed these eight days for song and praises.

SERVICE FOR PURIM

Before reading the Book of Esther the following Blessings are said:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning the reading of the Megillah.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who wroughtest miracles for our fathers in days of old, at this season.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.

After reading the Book of Esther say:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who dost plead our cause, judge our suit and avenge our wrong, who renderest retribution to all that hate our soul, and on our behalf dealest out punishment to our adversaries. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who on behalf of thy people Israel dealest out punishment to all their adversaries, O God, the Savior.

The following paragraph is omitted after the Reading of the Book of Esther in the morning:—

—Who broughtest the counsel of the heathen to nought, and madest the devices of the crafty of none effect, when a wicked man, an arrogant offshoot of the seed of Amalek, rose up against us. Insolent in his riches, he digged himself a pit, and his own greatness laid him a snare. In his mind he thought to entrap, but was himself entrapped, he sought to destroy, but was speedily destroyed. Haman displayed the hatred of his fathers, and stirred up against the children the ancient enmity of the brothers (Esau and Jacob), remembering not the mercy of Saul, through whose compassion for Agag the enemy was born. The wicked plotted to cut off the just, and the unclean was caught in the hands of the pure. (Mordecai's)

{p. 423}

lovingkindness (to Esther) prevailed over the father's (Saul's) error, but the wicked (Haman) heaped sin upon the sins of his ancestor. In his heart he hid his cunning devices, and sold himself to do wickedness. He stretched forth his hand against God's saints; he gave his silver to cut off the remembrance of them. When Mordecai saw that wrath had gone forth, and that the decrees of Haman were issued in Shushan, lie put on sackcloth and wrapped himself in mourning, ordained a fast and sat upon ashes. Who will rise up to atone for error, and obtain pardon for the sin rind iniquity of our fathers? A flower blossomed from the palm tree: lo! Hadassah arose to awaken the merit of those that slept in the grave. Her servants hastened to make Haman drink the wine of the poison of snakes. He rose by his riches, but fell in his wickedness; he made him a gallows, and was himself hanged thereon. All the inhabitants of the world opened their mouths, for the lot of Haman was turned to be our lot. When the righteous was delivered out of the hand of the wicked, and the enemy was put in his stead, the Jews ordained for themselves to celebrate Purim, and to rejoice thereon every year. Thou didst regard the prayer of Mordecai and Esther: Haman and his sons thou didst hang upon the gallows.

The lily of Jacob rejoiced and was glad when Mordecai was seen in the purple. Thou hast ever been Israel's salvation, and their hope in every generation, to make known that all who hope in thee shall not be ashamed, neither shall any be confounded who put their trust in thee. Accursed be Haman who sought to destroy me; blessed be Mordecai the Jew; accursed be Zeresh, the wife of him that terrified me; blessed be Esther my protectress, and may Harbonah also be remembered for good.

A Song of Degrees.—When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like unto them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with exultation: then said they among the nations, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereat we rejoiced. Bring back our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. Though he goeth on his way weeping, bearing the store of seed, he shall come back with joy, bearing his sheaves.

Through thy great goodness food hath never failed us: O may it not fail us for ever and ever for thy great name's sake, since thou nourishest and sustainest all beings and doest good unto all, and providest food for all thy creatures whom thou hast created. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who givest food unto all.

We thank thee, O Lord our God, because thou didst give as an heritage unto our fathers a desirable, good and ample land, and because thou didst bring us forth, O Lord our God, from the land of Egypt, and didst deliver us from the house of bondage; as well as for thy covenant which thou hast sealed in our flesh, thy Law which thou hast taught us, thy statutes which thou hast made known unto us, the life, grace and lovingkindness which thou hast vouchsafed unto us, and for the food wherewith thou dost constantly feed and sustain us on every day, in every season, at every hour.

PRAYERS BEFORE RETIRING TO REST AT NIGHT

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who makest the bands of sleep to fall upon mine eyes, and slumber upon mine eyelids. May it be thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, to suffer me to lie down in peace and to let me rise up again in peace. Let not my thoughts trouble me, nor evil dreams, nor evil fancies, but let my rest be perfect before thee. O lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death, for it is thou who givest light to the apple of the eye. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who givest light to the whole world in thy glory.

God, faithful King.

Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

Blessed he His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever.

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.

{p. 439}

And let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.

Psalm xci.

He that dwelleth in the shelter of the Most High, abideth under the shadow of the Almighty. I say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God in whom I trust.—For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his pinions, and under his wings shalt thou take refuge: his truth shall be a shield and a buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flieth by day; of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor of the plague that ravageth at noon day. A thousand may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; it shall not come nigh unto thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou look on, and see the retribution of the wicked.—For thou, O Lord, art my refuge.—Thou hast made the Most High thy dwelling place; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any scourge come nigh thy tent. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee upon their hands, lest thou strike thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder: upon the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample.—Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name. When he calleth upon me I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him and honor him. With length of days will I satisfy him, and will let him see my salvation. Repeat the last verse.

Psalm iii.

Lord, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me. Many there are which

{p. 440}

say of my soul, There is no salvation for him in God. (Selah.) But thou, O Lord, art a shield about me; my glory and the lifter up of mine head. I cry unto the Lord with my voice, and he answereth me from his holy mountain. (Selah.) I laid me down and slept; I have awaked, for the Lord sustaineth me. I will not be afraid of the ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about. Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing be upon thy people. (Selah.)

Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down in peace, and raise us up, O our King, unto life. Spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace; direct us aright through thine own good counsel; save us for thy name's sake; be thou a shield about us; remove from us every enemy, pestilence, sword, famine and sorrow; remove also the adversary from before us and from behind us. O shelter us beneath the shadow of thy wings; for thou, O God, art our Guardian and our Deliverer; yea, thou, O God, art a gracious and merciful King; and guard our going out and our coming in unto life and unto peace from this time forth and for evermore.

Blessed be the Lord by day; blessed be the Lord by night; blessed be the Lord when we lie down; blessed be the Lord when we rise up. For in thy hand are the souls of the living and the dead, as it is, said, In his hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. Into thy hand I commend my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, God of truth. Our God who art in heaven, assert the unity of thy name, and establish thy kingdom continually, and reign over us for ever and ever.

{p. 441}

May our eyes behold, our hearts rejoice, and our souls be glad in thy true salvation, when it shall be said unto Zion, Thy God reigneth. The Lord reigneth; the Lord hath reigned; the Lord shall reign for ever and ever: for the kingdom is thine, and to everlasting thou wilt reign in glory; for we have no king but thee.

The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.—And he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put. none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord that healeth thee—And the Lord said unto the adversary, The Lord rebuke thee, O adversary; yea, the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?—Behold the bed of Solomon: threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel: they all handle the sword, expert in war; every man hath his sword upon his thigh, because of fear in the night.—The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and he gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.

To be said three times:—

Behold, he that guardeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.

A Song of Degrees.—Happy is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways. When thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the recesses of thine house: thy children like olive plants, round about thy table. Behold thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord. May the Lord bless thee out of Zion: mayest thou see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. Yea, mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.

To be said three times:—

Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. (Selah.)

$He is Lord of the universe, who reigned ere any creature yet was formed:

At the time when all things were made by his desire, then was his name proclaimed King.

And after all things shall have had an end, he alone, the dreaded one, shall reign;

Who was, who is, and who will be in glory.

And he is One, and there is no second to compare to him, to consort with him:

Without beginning, without end; to him belong strength and dominion.

And he is my God—my Redeemer liveth—and a rock in my travail in time of distress;

And he is my banner and my refuge, the portion of my cup on the day when I call.

Into his hand I commend my spirit, when I sleep and when I wake;

And with my spirit, my body also: the Lord is with me, and I will not fear./$

Thy word have I treasured up within mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes. With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. I will meditate on thy precepts, and look towards thy paths.

Many are my persecutors and mine adversaries; yet have I not swerved from thy testimonies. I beheld the treacherous dealers, and loathed them; because they observed not thy word.

Then proceed as on {pr. 425}, "We will bless," etc.

After "in the sight of God and man," {pr. 430}, the following is introduced:—

May the All-merciful bless the father and mother of the child: may they be worthy to rear him, to initiate him in the precepts of the Law, and to train him in wisdom: from this eighth day and henceforth may his blood be accepted, and may the Lord his God be with him.

{p. 452}

May the All-merciful bless the godfather who has observed the covenant of Circumcision and rejoiced exceedingly to perform this deed of piety; may he requite him for his act with a double recompense, and ever exalt him more and more.

May the All-merciful bless the tender infant that has been circumcised on his eighth day; may his hands and heart be firm with God, and may he become worthy to appear before the Divine Presence three times in the year.

If the Mohel says Grace, one of the Company present says the following paragraph:—

May the All-merciful bless him who has circumcised the flesh of the foreskin, duly fulfilling each part of the precept. The service would be invalid of one who is timid and fainthearted, or who failed to perform the three essentials of the ceremony.

May the All-merciful, regardful of the merit of them that are akin by the blood of the circumcision, send us his anointed walking in his integrity, to give good tidings and consolation to the people that is scattered and dispersed among the peoples.

May the All-merciful send us the righteous priest, who remains withdrawn in concealment until a throne, bright as the sun and radiant as the diamond, shall be prepared for him, the prophet who covered his face with his mantle and wrapped himself therein, with whom is God's covenant of life and of peace.

Continue, "May the All-merciful make us worthy," etc., {pr. 430}.

SERVICE FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE FIRST-BORN

The first-born Child, if a male, must be redeemed on the thirty-first day of his birth. If, however, the Father be a Cohen or a Levite, or the Mother the daughter of a Cohen or a Levite, they are exempt from the duty of Redemption. Should the thirty-first day fall on a Sabbath or Holyday, the ceremony is postponed until the day following.

The Father, presenting his Child to the Cohen, makes the following declaration:—

This my first-born son is the first-born of his mother, and the Holy One, blessed be he, hath given command to redeem him, as it is said, And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, the shekel being twenty gerahs; and it is said, Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

The Father then places before the Cohen silver to the amount of five selaim or shekels (four dollars), and the Cohen asks:—

Which wouldst thou rather, give me thy first-born son, the first-born of his mother, or redeem him for five selaim, which thou art bound to give according to the Law?

The Father replies:—

I desire rather to redeem my son, and here thou hast the value of his redemption, which I am bound to give according to the Law.

{p. 454}

The Cohen receives the redemption money, and returns the Child to his Father, whereupon the latter says the following Blessing:—

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and given us command concerning the redemption of the son.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.

The Cohen then takes the redemption money, and, holding it over the head of the Child, says:—

This is instead of that, this in commutation for that, this in remission of that. May this child enter into life, into the Law and the fear of Heaven. May it be God's will that even as he has been admitted to redemption, so may he enter into the Law, the nuptial canopy, and into good deeds. Amen.

The Cohen places his hand upon the head of the Child, and pronounces the following Benediction:—

God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh. The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.

The Lord is thy guardian: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. For length of days, and years of life and peace shall they add to thee. The Lord shall guard thee from all evil; he shall guard thy soul. Amen.

PRAYER TO BE SAID BY A SICK PERSON

Psalm xxiii.

A Psalm of David. The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely happiness and lovingkindness will follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for length of days.

Psalm ciii.

A Psalm of David. Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and Forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquity; who healeth all thy diseases: who redeemeth thy life from the pit; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies: who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. The Lord executeth righteous acts, and judgments for all that are oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, his doings unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness. He will not always contend; neither will he keep his anger for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor requited us after our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so mighty is his lovingkindness over them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a father hath mercy upon his children, so the Lord hath mercy upon them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. As for man, his days are as grass; as the flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the lovingkindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children, to such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his precepts to do them. The Lord

{p. 456}

hath established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. Bless the Lord, ye his angels: ye mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his will. Bless the Lord, all ye his works, in all places of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul.

Psalm cxxxix.

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. O Lord, thou hast searched me, and knowest me. Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thoughts afar off. Thou siftest my path and my lying down, and art familiar with all my ways. For while there is not yet a word on my tongue, lo, thou, O Lord, knowest it all. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot attain unto it. Whither can I go from thy spirit? or whither can I flee from thy presence? If I ascend into heaven, thou art there: or if I make the grave my bed, behold thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Let deep darkness cover me, and the light about me be night; even the darkness darkeneth not from thee, but the night is light as the day—the darkness is as the light. For thou didst form my reins: thou didst weave me together in my mother's womb. I will give thanks unto thee, for that I am fearfully and wonderfully made: wonderful are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well. My frame was not hidden from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the depths of the earth. Thine eyes did see mine unshapen substance; and in thy book the days, even all of them that were to he formed, were written, and for it also there was one among them. How precious unto me are thy thoughts, O God! How great is the sum of them! If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. O that thou wouldst slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye bloodthirsty men: they who mention thee for treachery, thine adversaries who take the name in vain. Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and do not I strive with those that rise up against thee?

{p. 457}

{cont}I hate them with perfect hatred: they are become mine enemies. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any way of sorrow in me, and lead me in the way everlasting

A prayer of the afflicted when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee. Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: incline thy ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily. I beseech thee, O Lord, Healer of all flesh, have mercy upon me, and support me in thy grace upon my bed of sickness, for I am weak. Send me and all who are sick among thy children relief and cure. Assuage my pain, and renew my youth as the eagle's. Vouchsafe wisdom unto the physician that he may cure my wound, and so that my health may spring forth speedily. Hear my prayer, prolong my life, let me complete my years in happiness, that I may be enabled to serve thee and keep thy statutes with a perfect heart. Give me understanding to know that this bitter trial hath come upon me for my welfare, so that I may not despise thy chastening nor weary of thy reproof.

O God of forgiveness, who art gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness, I confess unto thee with a broken and contrite heart that I have sinned, and have done that which is evil in thy sight. Behold, I repent me of my evil way, and return unto thee with perfect repentance. Help me, O God of my salvation, that I may not again turn unto folly, but walk before thee in truth and uprightness. Rejoice the soul of thy servant, for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed, save me, and I shall be saved, for thou art my praise. Amen, and Amen!

THE BURIAL SERVICE

On those days on which Tachanun ({pr. 70}) is not said, Psalm xvi. ({pr. 460}) is read instead of the following:—

The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are judgment: a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he. The Rock, perfect in every work, who can say unto him, What workest thou? He ruleth below and above; he killeth and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up again. The Rock, perfect in every deed, who can say unto him, What doest thou? O thou who speakest and doest, of thy grace deal kindly with us, and for the sake of him who was bound like a lamb, O hearken and do. Just in all thy ways art thou, O perfect Rock, slow to anger and full of compassion. Spare and have pity upon parents and children, for thine, Lord, is forgiveness and compassion. Just art thou, O Lord, in killing and in making alive, in whose hand is the charge of all spirits; far be it from thee to blot out our remembrance: O let thine eyes mercifully regard us for thine, Lord, is compassion and forgiveness. If a man live a year or a thousand years, what profiteth it him? He shall be as though he had not been. Blessed be the true Judge, who killeth and maketh alive. Blessed be he, for his judgment is true, and his eye discerneth all things, and he awardeth unto man his reckoning and his sentence, and all must render acknowledgment unto him. We know, O Lord, that thy judgment is righteous: thou art justified when thou speakest, and pure when thou judgest, and it is not for us to murmur at thy method of judging; just art thou, O Lord, and righteous are thy judgments. O true and righteous judge! Blessed be the true judge, all whose judgments are righteous and true. The soul of every living thing is in thy hand; thy right hand is full of righteousness. Have mercy

{p. 460}

upon the remnant of the flock of thy hand, and say unto the angel, Stay thy hand. Thou art great in counsel and mighty in deed; thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the children of men, to give unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. To declare that the Lord is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. And he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up all his wrath.

Psalm xvi.

Michtam of David.—Guard me, O God, for in thee do I take refuge. I say unto the Lord, Thou art my lord: I have no good beyond thee. As for the saints that are in the earth, they are the noble ones in whom is all my delight. Their sorrows will be multiplied that have gotten unto themselves another God: their drink offerings of blood will I not pour out, nor take their names upon my lips. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a delightsome heritage. I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: yea, my reins admonish me in the night seasons. I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart rejoiceth and my glory is glad: my flesh also will dwell in safety. For thou will not abandon my soul to the grave: neither wilt thou suffer thy loving one to see the pit. Thou wilt make known to me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures from evermore.

The coffin is borne from the Hall to the Burial Ground, Those who have not visited the Burial Ground for thirty days, say the following:—

Blessed be the Lord our God, King of the universe, who formed you in judgment, who nourished and sustained you in judgment, who brought death on you in judgment, who knoweth the number of you all in judgment, and will hereafter restore you to life in judgment. Blessed art thou. O Lord, who quickenest the dead.

{p. 461}

Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art mighty to save. Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth? Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead.

When the coffin is lowered into the Grave, the following is said, the sentence being varied according to the sex of the departed:—

May he come to his place in peace.

May she come to her place in peace.

On quitting the Burial Ground it is customary to pluck some grass, and to say one of the following sentences:—

And they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.

He remembereth that we are dust.

All those who have been present at the Interment wash their hands and say:—

He will destroy death for ever; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.

They then return to the Hall, and say, "And let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be upon us," to "my salvation," {pr. 439}.

{p. 462}

The following Kaddish is said by children after the Burial of their Parents. On those days on which Tachanun is not said ({pr. 70}) the Kaddish, {pr. 94}, is substituted.

Mourners.—May his great name be magnified and sanctified in the world that is to be created anew, where he will quicken the dead, and raise them up into life eternal; will rebuild the city of Jerusalem, and establish his temple in the midst thereof; and will up, root all alien worship from the earth and restore the worship of the true God.

PRAYER IN THE HOUSE OF MOURNING

After the ordinary Daily Service, the following Psalm (xlix.) is read in the House of the Mourner. On those days on which Tachanun ({pr. 70}) is not said, Psalm xvi. p. 460, is substituted for Psalm xlix.

Psalm xlix. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.

Hear this all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: both low and high, rich and poor together. My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying to the lyre. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of them that would supplant me compasseth me about, even of them that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches? None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: (for the redemption of their soul is costly, and must be let alone for ever:) that he should still live always, that he should not see the pit. For he will see that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, and leave their wealth to others. Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. But man that is in glory abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. This is the way of them that are foolish, and of those who after them take pleasure in their speech. (Selah.) Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall be their shepherd: but the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their form shall be for the grave to consume, that there be no habitation for it. But God will redeem my soul from the grasp of the grave: for he will receive me. (Selah.) Be not thou afraid when a man becometh rich, when the glory of his house is increased; for at his death he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him. Though while he lived he blessed his soul, and though men praise thee that thou doest well unto thyself, he shall go to the generation of his fathers, who shall never see the light. Man that is in glory, but without understanding, is like the beasts that perish.

In addition to the above, other appropriate Psalms, such as Psalms xv., {pr. 445}; xc., {pr. 26}; xci., {pr. 27}; ciii., {pr. 455}; and xxxix., or such passages as Proverbs xxxi. 10–31, {pr. 180}, should be read in the House of Mourning.

Psalm xxxix.

For the Chief Musician, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.—I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. I was dumb, and kept silence, I held my peace, and had no comfort: and my sorrow was stirred. My heart was hot within me; while I was musing the fire kindled: then spake I with my tongue: Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; let me know how fleeting I am. Behold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths; and my lifetime is as nothing before thee: surely every man, though he stand firm, is but a breath. (Selah.) Surely as a mere semblance every man walketh to and fro: surely they are disquieted for vanity: he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them. And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee. Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the foolish. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it. Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to waste away like a moth: surely every man is a breath. (Selah.) Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears; for I am a stranger with thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were. O spare me, that I may again be glad, before I go hence, and be no more.

O Lord and King, who art full of compassion, in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all flesh, who killest and makest alive, who bringest down to the grave and bringest up again, receive, we beseech thee, in thy great lovingkindness the soul of — who hath been gathered unto his [her] people. Have mercy upon him

{p. 465}

{cont}[her]; pardon all his [her] transgressions, for there is not a righteous man upon earth, who doeth good and sinneth not. Remember unto him [her] the righteousness which he [she] wrought, and let his [her] reward be with him [her], and his [her] recompense before him [her]. O shelter his [her] soul in the shadow of thy wings. Make known to him [her] the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore. Vouchsafe unto him [her] of the abounding happiness that is treasured up for the righteous, as it is written, Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the children of men!

O Lord, who healest the broken-hearted and bindest up their wounds, grant thy consolation unto the mourners: put into their hearts the fear and love of thee, that they may serve thee with a perfect heart, and let their latter end be peace. Amen.

Like one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, and in Jerusalem shall ye be comforted. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. He will destroy death for ever; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.

SERVICE AT THE SETTING OF A TOMBSTONE

Psalm i.

Happy is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also doth not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The wicked are not so; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.

Psalm xv., {pr. 445}; xvi. {pr. 460}; xc. {pr. 26}.

As for man, his days are as grass; as the flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the lovingkindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children. Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end. For at his death he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him. Mark the innocent man, and behold the upright; for the latter end of that man is peace. The Lord setteth free the soul of his servants; and none that take refuge in him shall be condemned. How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. They sate themselves with the fatness of thy house; and thou givest them to drink of the river of thy pleasures. He shall enter into peace; they shall rest on their beds—each one that walketh in his uprightness.

MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR THE DEAD

On Holy Days, when the Memorial Service is held, and on the Anniversaries of the Death of Parents, the following is said:—

Lord, what is man, that thou regardest him? or the son of man, that thou takest account of him? Man is like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away. In the morning he flourisheth, and sprouteth afresh; in the evening he is cut down, and withereth. So teach us to number our days that we may get us a heart of wisdom. Mark the innocent man, and behold the upright: for the latter end of that man is peace. But God will redeem my soul from the grasp of the grave: for he will receive me. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever. And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, but the spirit returneth unto God who gave it. I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

May God remember the soul of my revered father [mother] who has gone to his [her] repose. May his [her] soul be bound up in the bond of life. May his [her] rest be glorious, with fulness of joy in thy presence, and pleasures for evermore at thy right hand.

Father of mercy, in whose hand are the souls of the living and the dead, may thy consolation cheer us as we remember (on this holy day) our beloved and honored kinsfolk who have gone to their rest, our dear parents, the crown of our head and our glory, whose desire it was to train us in the good and righteous way, to teach us thy statutes and commandments,

{p. 468}

and to instruct us to do justice and to love mercy. We beseech thee, O Lord, grant us strength to be faithful to their charge while the breath of life is within us. And may their souls repose in the land of the living, beholding thy glory and delighting in thy goodness.

And now, O good and beneficent God, what shall we say, what shall we speak unto thee? Our needs are many, our knowledge slender. Shame covers us as often as the remembrance of all thy love for us rises within our minds. O turn this day in lovingkindness and tender mercy to the prayers of thy servants who pour out their souls before thee. May thy lovingkindness not depart from us. Give us our needful sustenance, and let us not be in want of the gifts of flesh and blood. Remove from us care and {sic "sorow" "sorrow"}, distress and fear, shame and contempt. Let thy grace be with us, that we may rear our children to keep thy commandments and to fulfil thy will all the days of their life. O God, take us not hence in the midst of our days. Let us complete in peace the number of our years. Verily we know that our strength is frail, and that thou hast made our days as handbreadths. Help us, O God of our salvation, to bear ourselves faithfully and blamelessly during the years of our pilgrimage. And when our end draws nigh and we depart this world, be thou with us, and may our souls be bound up in the bond of life with the souls of our parents and of the righteous who are ever with thee.

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

And these words which I command thee this day shall be Capon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates.

Blessed be the Lord by day; blessed be the Lord by night. Blessed be the Lord when we lie down; blessed be the Lord when we rise up.

Behold, he that guardeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.

Into thy hand I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.

For thy salvation I hope, O Lord.
